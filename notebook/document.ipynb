In May, we learnt that the Indian economy is \\nestimated to have grown 8.2% in real terms in FY24. In June, a new government took office. The \\nNational Democratic Alliance government led by Prime Minister Narendra Modi has returned \\nto power with a historic mandate for a third term. His unprecedented third popular mandate \\nsignals political and policy continuity.\\nThe Indian economy is on a strong wicket and stable footing, demonstrating resilience \\nin the face of geopolitical challenges. The Indian economy has consolidated its post-Covid \\nrecovery with policymakers – fiscal and monetary – ensuring economic and financial stability. \\nNonetheless, change is the only constant for a country with high growth aspirations. For \\nthe recovery to be sustained, there has to be heavy lifting on the domestic front because the \\nenvironment has become extraordinarily difficult to reach agreements on key global issues such \\nas trade, investment and climate.\\nHigh economic growth in FY24 came on the heels of growth rates of 9.7% and 7.0%, \\nrespectively, in the previous two financial years. The headline inflation rate is largely under \\ncontrol, although the inflation rate of some specific food items is elevated. The trade deficit \\nwas lower in FY24 than in FY23, and the current account deficit for the year is around 0.7% of \\nGDP. In fact, the current account registered a surplus in the last quarter of the financial year. \\nForeign exchange reserves are ample. Public investment has sustained capital formation in the \\nlast several years even as the private sector shed its balance sheet blues and began investing \\nin FY22. Now, it has to receive the baton from the public sector and sustain the investment \\nmomentum in the economy. The signs are encouraging.\\nNational income data show that non-financial private-sector capital formation, measured \\nin current prices, expanded vigorously in FY22 and FY23 after a decline in FY21. However, \\ninvestment in machinery and equipment declined for two consecutive years, FY20 and FY21, \\nbefore rebounding strongly. Early corporate sector data for FY24 suggest that capital formation \\nin the private sector continued to expand but at a slower rate.\\nSustaining overseas investor interest will require effort\\nForeign Direct Investment, the subject of much analysis, has held up. RBI data on India’s \\nBalance of Payments shows us that the investment interest of external investors, measured in \\nterms of dollar inflows of new capital, was USD45.8 billion in FY24 compared to USD47.6 billion \\nin FY23. This slight decline is in line with global trends. Reinvestment of earnings remained the \\nsame. Repatriation of investment was USD29.3 billion in FY23 and USD44.5 billion in FY24. \\nMany private equity investors took advantage of buoyant equity markets in India and exited \\nprofitably. It is a sign of a healthy market environment that offers profitable exits to investors, \\nwhich will bring newer investments in the years to come. That said, the environment for foreign \\ndirect investment to grow in the coming years is not highly favourable for many reasons.\\nInterest rates in developed countries are much higher than they were during and before \\nCovid years. This not only means a higher cost of funding but also a higher opportunity cost to \\ninvest abroad. Second, emerging economies have to compete with active industrial policies in \\ndeveloped economies involving considerable subsidies that encourage domestic investment.'),\n",

Lastly, geopolitical uncertainties, which are on the rise, will likely exert a bigger \\ninfluence on capital flows, notwithstanding other reasons for preferring to invest in India.\\nShocks and not structural forces have influenced employment\\nOn employment generation, the Periodic Labour Force Survey provides quarterly data \\non urban employment indicators and annually for the entire country, including rural India. \\nA surge in agriculture employment is partly explained by reverse migration and the entry \\nof women into the labour force in rural India. The Annual Survey of Industries has data on \\nworkers in nearly 2.0 lakh Indian factories. The total number of factory jobs grew annually by \\n3.6% between 2013-14 and 2021-22. Somewhat more satisfyingly, they grew faster at 4.0% in \\nfactories employing more than a hundred workers than in smaller factories (those with less \\nthan a hundred workers). The annual growth rate was 1.2% in the latter set of factories. In \\nabsolute numbers, employment in Indian factories has grown from 1.04 crore to 1.36 crore \\nin this period. India does not yet have a corresponding Annual Survey of Services. The lack of \\navailability of timely data on the absolute number of (formal and informal) jobs created even \\nat annual intervals, let alone at higher frequencies, in various sectors – agriculture, industry \\nincluding manufacturing and services – precludes an objective analysis of the labour market \\nsituation in the country.\\nThe Annual Survey of Unincorporated Enterprises for 2022-23, when compared with \\nthe results of the NSS 73rd round of the ‘Key Indicators of Unincorporated Non-Agricultural \\nEnterprises (Excluding Construction) in India’ shows that overall employment in these \\nenterprises fell from 11.1 crore in 2015-16 to 10.96 crores. There was a reduction of 54 lakh \\nworkers in manufacturing but the expansion of the workforce in trade and services gained in jobs \\nlimited the overall reduction in the number of workers in unincorporated enterprises to around \\n16.45 lakhs between these two periods. This comparison masks a big jump in manufacturing \\njobs that seems to have occurred between 2021-22 (April 2021 to March 2022) and 2022-23 \\n(October 2022 to September 2023).\\nIndia suffered two big economic shocks in quick succession. Bad debts in the banking system \\nand high corporate indebtedness were one. It took the first term of the present government \\nand more to bring it under control. The Covid pandemic was the second shock and quickly \\nfollowed the first one. So, it is difficult to conclude that the Indian economy’s ability to create \\nemployment is structurally impaired. Nonetheless, going forward, the task is cut out. \\nBetween the last Economic survey published in January 2023 and this one, big changes are \\nafoot in the geopolitical environment. The global backdrop for India’s march towards Viksit \\nBharat in 2047 could not be more different from what it was during the rise of China between \\n1980 and 2015. Then, globalisation was at the cusp of its long expansion. Geopolitics was largely \\ncalm with the end of the Cold War, and Western powers welcomed and even encouraged the \\nrise of China and its integration into the world economy. Concerns over climate change and \\nglobal warming were not so pervasive or grave then as they are now. Fourth, the advent of \\nArtificial Intelligence casts a huge pall of uncertainty as to its impact on workers across all skill \\nlevels – low, semi and high. These will create barriers and hurdles to sustained high growth \\nrates for India in the coming years and decades. Overcoming these requires a grand alliance of \\nunion and state governments and the private sector.'),\n",

Results of a sample of over 33,000 \\ncompanies show that, in the three years between FY20 and FY23, the profit before taxes of \\nthe Indian corporate sector nearly quadrupled. Further, newspaper headlines told us that the \\ncorporate profits-to-GDP ratio rose to a 15-year high in FY24. BusinessLine reported, “The \\ncorporate profit for the Nifty-500 universe was up 30 per cent last fiscal to ₹14.11-lakh crore \\nagainst ₹10.88 lakh crore in FY23. The nominal GDP grew 9.6 per cent y-o-y to ₹295-lakh crore \\n(₹269-lakh crore)1”. Hiring and compensation growth hardly kept up with it. But, it is in the \\ninterest of the companies to step up hiring and worker compensation.\\nThe Union government cut taxes in September 2019 to facilitate capital formation. Has the \\ncorporate sector responded? Between FY19 and FY23, the cumulative growth in private sector \\nnon-financial Gross Fixed Capital Formation (GFCF) is 52% in current prices. During the same \\nperiod, the cumulative growth in general government (which includes states) is 64%. The gap \\ndoes not appear to be too wide.\\nHowever, when we break it down, a different picture emerges. Private sector GFCF in \\nmachinery and equipment and intellectual property products has grown cumulatively by only \\n35% in the four years to FY23. Meanwhile, its GFCF in ‘Dwellings, other buildings and structures’ \\nhas increased by 105%. This is not a healthy mix. Second, the slow pace of investment in M&E \\nand IP Products will delay India’s quest to raise the manufacturing share of GDP, delay the \\nimprovement in India’s manufacturing competitiveness, and create only a smaller number of \\nhigher-quality formal jobs than otherwise.\\nNonetheless, there is a silver lining in the data. In the two years since FY21, GFCF by the \\nprivate sector has grown faster. General government GFCF rose a cumulative 42% between \\nFY21 and FY23. Non-Financial Private Sector’s overall GFCF increased by 51%; investment \\nin Machinery and Equipment and Intellectual Property Products increased by 38%. So, the \\ngrowth in these two critical sub-components of Private Sector GFCF is similar to that of the \\noverall GFCF by the General Government. This is a statistic that bears watching. They should \\ncontinue to invest. To do so, they need demand visibility. That comes from employment and \\nincome growth. \\nIn a recent article,2 the Economist cites independent research that predicted a slow demise \\nof India’s services exports over the next decade. While the boom in telecommunications and \\nthe rise of the internet facilitated business process outsourcing, the next wave of technological \\nevolution might bring the curtains down on it. In this milieu, the corporate sector has a \\nresponsibility, as much to itself as it is to society, to think harder about ways AI will augment \\nlabour rather than displace workers. Hiring in the IT sector has slowed significantly in the last \\ntwo years. We do not have a full picture of overall corporate hiring in the country on a regular \\n1\\u2003 \\x07‘Corporate profit to GDP hits 15 year high as input cost moderates’, BusinessLine, 11th June 2024 (https://\\nwww.thehindubusinessline.com/economy/corporate-profit-to-gdp-hits-15-year-high-as-input-cost-moderates/\\narticle68277319.ece)\\n2\\u2003 \\x07‘Will Services make the world rich?’, The Economist, 24th June 2024 (https://www.economist.com/finance-\\nand-economics/2024/06/24/will-services-make-the-world-rich)'),\n",

In any case, deploying capital-intensive and energy-intensive AI is probably one of the \\nlast things a growing, lower-middle-income economy needs. \\nA Staff Discussion Note of the International Monetary Fund published in June 20243 \\nnotes that Generative Artificial Intelligence raised profound concerns about massive labour \\ndisruptions and inequality. The IMF SDN goes on to recommend well-designed excess corporate \\nprofit taxes and high personal income taxes on capital through better enforcement of automatic \\ninformation exchange between countries and enhanced taxation of capital gains. However, \\nemployment is about dignity, self-worth, self-esteem, self-respect, and standing in the family \\nand community, not just about the income it brings. That is why it is in the enlightened self-\\ninterest of the Indian corporate sector, swimming in excess profits, to take its responsibility to \\ncreate jobs seriously. Of course, it must find people with the right attitude and skills. \\nThat requires another tripartite compact - between the government, the private sector and \\nacademia. This compact is to reboot the mission to skill and equip Indians to catch up with and \\nget ahead of technological evolution. To succeed in the mission, governments must unshackle \\nthe industry and academic institutions to play their respective roles in that mammoth task. \\nFor example, despite several amendments over the years, the Apprenticeship Act remains a \\nwork in progress, at best, in encouraging large-scale apprenticeships in the country. The New \\nEducation Policy 2020 proposes freeing India’s higher education from regulatory oversight \\nto market oversight. A corporate sector that helps shape the design of higher education with \\ninputs to curriculum, evaluation standards, and faculty will pave the way for a high-quality \\nhigher education that market competition brings, replacing regulatory oversight. If anything, \\nanother article4 in The Economist that hails the arrival of China as a superpower in science \\nshould be sufficient inspiration for the corporate sector and academia to get their act together \\non scientific research and development.\\nThe real corporate social responsibility\\nThe role of the corporate sector has never been greater than it is now. Two other areas of \\ncorporate responsibility deserve mention here. The pandemic saw the emergence of the Indian \\nretail investor as the bulwark of market stability. The culture of investing for the long term has \\nto be nurtured and sustained. Market practices that take their cues from the thinly disguised \\nleveraged bets masquerading as financial innovations in the developed world have no place \\nin a developing country with a low per-capita income. Second, just as corporate profits are \\nbooming, the net interest margin of Indian banks has risen to a multi-year high. It is a good \\nthing. Profitable banks lend more. To sustain the good times, it is important not to forget the \\nlessons of the last financial cycle downturn. The banking industry must aim to lengthen the gap \\nbetween two NPA cycles. It should also resist the temptation to pursue short-term profits at the \\nexpense of the customer. Product misselling is too rampant to be dismissed as an aberration of \\na few overenthusiastic sales personnel. The same can be said of the insurance industry as well. \\nPrompt and reasonable settlement of insurance claims and a lower rejection rate are necessary \\nto increase insurance penetration. Acknowledgement of misselling and misrepresentation and \\ncompensating for consequential losses is a good business practice enjoined upon stockbroking, \\nfund management, banking and insurance firms. \\nCorporates benefit from the higher demand generated by employment and income growth. \\nThe financial sector benefits from channelling household savings for investment purposes. \\n3\\u2003 \\x07‘Broadening the gains from Generative AI: the role of fiscal policies’, Staff Discussion Note, International \\nMonetary Fund, June 2024 (https://tinyurl.com/39dy7dv3)\\n4\\u2003 \\x07‘China has become a scientific superpower’, The Economist, 12th June 2024 (https://www.economist.com/\\nscience-and-technology/2024/06/12/china-has-become-a-scientific-superpower)'),\n",

Short-termism can weaken these linkages.\\nFor India’s working-age population to be gainfully employed, they need skills and good \\nhealth. Social media, screen time, sedentary habits, and unhealthy food are a lethal mix that \\ncan undermine public health and productivity and diminish India’s economic potential. The \\nprivate sector’s contribution to this toxic mix of habits is substantial, and that is myopic. The \\nemerging food consumption habits of Indians are not only unhealthy but also environmentally \\nunsustainable. India’s traditional lifestyle, food and recipes have shown how to live healthily \\nand in harmony with nature and the environment for centuries. It makes commercial sense for \\nIndian businesses to learn about and embrace them, for they have a global market waiting to \\nbe led rather than tapped.\\nGovernments, on their part…\\nPolicymakers – elected or appointed – have to rise to the challenge as well. There has to \\nbe conversation, cooperation, collaboration, and coordination across ministries, states, and \\nbetween the union and states. Few people outside the government – living or dead – can \\nunderstand the complexity of governing and transforming a nation of India’s (population) size, \\n(geographical) spread and social and cultural diversity within a democratic framework. The \\npolitical class, with its ears to the ground and the civil service, with its exposure to districts, \\nstates and central Ministries, have a better shot at (at least) a partial understanding of this \\ncomplexity. They intuitively know there is no place for exclusive approaches and binary choices, \\nwhich are the staple of sterile discussions and discourses. Examples are urban vs. rural, growth \\nvs. equity or development, and manufacturing vs. services. They intuitively know that India \\nneeds multiple development pathways. That is a good thing. But it is easier said than done. It \\nhas not been done before. Not on this scale. Not in the time frame and not amidst a turbulent \\nglobal environment. Forging and sustaining  consensus between governments, businesses and \\nthe social sectors are necessary to succeed in this endeavour.\\nAgriculture can be a growth engine if…\\nThe agriculture sector is one area ripe for and in need of such a pan-India dialogue. \\nAgriculture and farmers matter for a nation. Most countries understand that. India is no \\nexception. India subsidises their water, electricity and fertilisers. The former two are provided \\nvirtually free. Their incomes are not taxed. The government offers them a minimum support \\nprice (MSP) for 23 selected commodities. Monthly cash support is offered to farmers through \\nthe PM-KISAN scheme. Indian governments – national and sub-national –write off their loans. \\nSo, governments in India spend enough resources to look after the farmers well. Yet, a case can \\nbe made that they can be served better with some re-orientation of existing and new policies.\\nA panoply of policies – by national and sub-national governments - working at cross-\\npurposes with each other is hurting farmers’ interests, destroying soil fertility, depleting \\ngroundwater, polluting rivers and the environment with nitrous oxide emissions, starving the \\ncrops of nutrients and undermining people’s health with a diet rich in sugar and carbohydrates \\nrather than fibre and protein. The payoff will be immense if we untie the knots that bedevil farm \\nsector policies. More than anything else, it will restore faith in the self-confidence and ability of \\nthe state to steer the nation to a better future, apart from delivering socio-economic benefits. \\nEarlier development models featured economies migrating from farm beginnings to \\nindustrialisation to value-added services in their development journey.

The first has been the focus on public spending on infrastructure, which \\nkept the economy afloat by creating a strong demand for jobs and industrial output \\nand triggered a lagged yet vigorous private investment response. Stronger balance \\nsheets of the financial and non-financial private sector helped, aided by a decade of \\nsupporting initiatives by the Government and the Reserve Bank of India. The second has \\nbeen partly a natural response of business enterprise and public administration amidst \\nadversities, i.e., digitalisation of service delivery. The public policy focus and nurturing \\nof processes and frameworks in digital technology greatly helped this irreversible and \\ntransformational change. The third has been embodied in the Atmanirbhar Bharat \\nAbhiyan in terms of targeted relief to different sectors of the economy and sections of \\nthe population, and structural reforms that assisted a firm recovery and increased the \\nmedium-term growth potential. \\nGlobal troubles, supply chain disruptions, and vagaries of monsoons intermittently \\nstoked domestic inflationary pressures, which were, to a great extent, managed by \\nadministrative and monetary policy responses.  The fiscal balances of the general \\ngovernment—central and State Governments taken together - have improved \\nprogressively despite expansionary public investment. Tax compliance gains driven \\nby procedural reforms, expenditure restraint, and increasing digitisation helped \\nIndia achieve this fine balance. The external balance has been pressured by subdued \\nglobal demand for goods, but strong services exports largely counterbalanced this. \\nGlobal output is now somewhat more resilient than in 2022, inflationary pressures are \\nshrinking, and trade is set to recover, should there be no further geo-political shocks \\nor flare-ups. However, the chances of geopolitical disturbances and conflicts have only \\ngone up in recent times.\\nThe net impact of these developments has been that the Indian economy recovered and \\nexpanded in an orderly fashion in the last three years. The real GDP in FY24 was 20 \\nper cent higher than its level in FY20, a feat that only a very few major economies \\nachieved, while also leaving a strong possibility for robust growth in FY25 and beyond. \\nGrowth has been inclusive with a reduction in unemployment and multi-dimensional \\npoverty and an increase in labour force participation. Overall, the Indian economy \\nlooks forward to FY25 optimistically, anticipating broad-based and inclusive growth.'),\n",

The drop in the benchmark borrowing cost \\nwill cause interest rates to decline in general, leading to overall lower cost of borrowing for \\nhouseholds and businesses. That would be a fiscal stimulus in itself. \\nModeration in inflation pressure\\n1.40\\t Despite global supply chain disruptions and adverse weather conditions, domestic \\ninflationary pressures moderated in FY24. After averaging 6.7 per cent in FY23, retail inflation \\ndeclined to 5.4 per cent in FY24. This has been due to the combination of measures undertaken \\nby the Government and the RBI. The Union Government undertook prompt measures such as \\nopen market sales, retailing in specified outlets, timely imports, reduced the prices of Liquified \\nPetroleum Gas (LPG) cylinders and implemented a cut in petrol and diesel prices. The RBI \\nraised policy rates by a cumulative 250 bps between May 2022 and February 2023. It also \\nmanaged liquidity levels efficiently and maintained consistent and coherent communication \\nwith market participants. Even as higher policy rates are transmitted through the system, the \\nRBI continues to support growth with adequate liquidity, thereby ensuring that inflation is \\nheaded to the target of 4 per cent on a durable basis. The effects of these measures are reflected \\nin the latest data on CPI inflation – headline CPI inflation of 5.1 per cent in June 2024, and core \\ninflation declined to 3.1 per cent. Consequently, India was the only country amongst its peers \\nto traverse a high-growth and low-inflation path in the period FY22 – FY24 (Chart I.53). This is \\ndespite the fact that there were pressures on the food inflation front, driven by adverse weather \\nconditions. \\n36  Table 4.2 of PDMC quarterly report (January – March 2024) (https://tinyurl.com/mrxaf4kw)\"),\n",

MoSPI anchors the core statistics by publishing GDP, price and \\nvolume indices and countrywide surveys of macroeconomic and sectoral importance. The \\nMinistry has initiated various new surveys, namely, the annual survey of unincorporated \\nsector enterprises, a time-use survey and started a pilot for an annual survey of service \\nsector enterprises. MoSPI is also working towards increasing the frequency of PLFS data \\nand extending the generation of quarterly estimates for rural areas. Modern IT tools are \\nbeing adopted for improved data capturing and processing. To encourage greater use of \\nadministrative data, a National Metadata Structure is also being developed. The Unified \\nData Portal project has been envisaged by MoSPI with the objective of creating a centralised \\ndatabase and storage system. Ministries are also taking initiatives to enhance the frequency \\nof various surveys to make more informed policy decisions. Given India’s 2047 goals, it \\nis important for development policy that (a) MoSPI is capacitated fully to produce and \\nintegrate all required statistics with the desired quality, regularity and timeliness and (b) \\nthe quality and timeliness of administrative and transactional data of the line Ministries are \\nbrought to levels that fully facilitate timely course corrections.  \\nFurther steps to strengthen the statistical database\\na)\\t An extensive exercise for base revision of important economic statistics is being taken \\nup at MoSPI. The exercise to change the base year of CPI from 2012 to 2024 has been \\ninitiated. An Advisory Committee on National Accounts Statistics has been set up to \\ndecide on the base year for GDP. It is important that the base year of critical data series like \\nthe GDP, different price indices and volume indices like Index of Industrial Production \\n(IIP) are updated to the most recent feasible year at the earliest. The ongoing efforts \\nto construct the producer price index for goods and services may be expedited to have \\na greater grasp of episodes of cost-push inflation.

If the services inflation across economies moderates faster, that may allow central banks \\nto bring forward the monetary policy easing cycle earlier than currently anticipated. A likely \\nreduction in policy rates by central banks of AEs, especially the Fed, will open the space for \\ncentral banks of EMEs to follow the lead, bringing down the cost of capital. \\n1.54\\t On the downside, any escalation of geopolitical conflicts in 2024 may lead to supply \\ndislocations, higher commodity prices, reviving inflationary pressures and stalling monetary \\npolicy easing with potential repercussions for capital flows. This can also influence RBI’s \\nmonetary policy stance. The global trade outlook for 2024 remains positive, with merchandise \\ntrade expected to pick up after registering a contraction in volumes in 2023. Conversely, \\nincreased fragmentation along geopolitical lines and renewed thrust on protectionism may \\ndistort merchandise trade growth, impacting India’s external sector. Global financial markets \\nhave scaled new heights, with investors betting on global economic expansion. However, any \\ncorrections in the elevated financial market valuations may have ramifications for household \\nfinances and corporate valuation, negatively impacting growth prospects. Hiring in the \\ninformation technology sector had slowed down considerably in FY24, and even if hiring does \\nnot decline further, it is unlikely to pick up significantly. However, leveraging the initiatives \\ntaken by the government and capturing the untapped potential in emerging markets, exports of \\nbusiness, consultancy and IT-enabled services can expand. Despite the core inflation rate being \\naround 3 per cent, the RBI, with one eye on the withdrawal of accommodation and another on \\nthe US Fed, has kept interest rates unchanged for quite some time, and the anticipated easing \\nhas been delayed.\\n1.55\\t Domestic growth drivers have supported economic growth in FY24 despite uncertain \\nglobal economic performance. Improved balance sheets will help the private sector cater to \\nstrong investment demand. A note of caution is warranted here. Private capital formation after \\ngood growth in the last three years may turn slightly more cautious because of fears of cheaper'),\n",

The primary objective of monetary policy is to maintain price stability while \\nkeeping in mind the objective of growth. Various instruments of monetary policy, viz. cash \\nreserve ratio (CRR) and statutory liquidity ratio (SLR) of banks, open market operations of \\nthe Central Bank, and imposition of credit ceilings, etc., are used by the central bank in the \\ndirection of this overall objective. This section of the chapter presents the recent monetary \\ndevelopments in the economy, focussing on the emerging liquidity conditions and monetary \\npolicy transmission in terms of lending and deposit rates of banks.\\nMonetary and Credit Conditions\\n2.6\\t\\nMonetary and credit conditions evolved in line with the monetary policy stance during \\nthe year, supporting domestic economic activity. The Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) \\nmaintained the status quo on the policy repo rate at 6.5 per cent in FY24. It focused on \\nwithdrawing accommodation to ensure that inflation gradually aligns with the target while \\nsupporting growth. With the cumulative policy repo rate hike of 250 basis points (bps), \\nundertaken between May 2022 and February 2023, working its way through the economy, \\nthe MPC kept the policy repo rate unchanged at 6.5 per cent since February 2023, but with \\nreadiness to undertake appropriate and timely policy actions if the situation so warrants. \\n2.7\\t\\nImportant factors impacting the evolution of monetary and credit conditions during \\nFY24 were the withdrawal of ₹2,000 banknotes (May 2023)2, the merger of HDFC, a non-bank \\nwith HDFC Bank (July 2023), and the temporary imposition of the incremental CRR (I-CRR) \\n(August 2023). The expansion in reserve money and currency in circulation (CiC) moderated \\ndue to the return of a predominant part of ₹2,000 banknotes to the banking system as deposits. \\nAs per the Reserve Bank of India (RBI), the total value of ₹2,000 banknotes in circulation has \\ndeclined from ₹3.56 lakh crore as of 19 May 2023 (when the withdrawal of ₹2,000 banknotes \\nwas announced) to ₹7,581 crore as of 28 June 2024, indicating that 97.87 per cent of the ₹2,000 \\ndenomination banknotes have returned to the banking system.3 This and an increase in term \\ndeposit rates contributed to an acceleration in aggregate deposits and broad money (M3). The \\ngrowth in CiC moderated to 4.1 per cent from 7.8 per cent YoY in the last year, reflecting the \\nimpact of the withdrawal of ₹2,000 banknotes.\\n2.8\\t\\nReserve Money (M0) recorded a year-on-year (YoY) growth of 6.7 per cent as of 29 March \\n2024, compared to 9.7 per cent in the previous year.

In \\naddition, 49 fine-tuning operations (25 VRRR and 24 VRR) were conducted intermittently, \\nmodulating liquidity conditions in alignment with the monetary policy stance. Amidst tightened \\nliquidity conditions, banks also took recourse to the marginal standing facility (MSF).

The last decade saw Indian commercial banks face a crisis due to the \\nsignificant burden of NPA. As of March 2016, the GNPA ratio of the public sector banks was \\n14.5 per cent.  The other side of this was the plateauing of the bank debt, which fuelled an \\nincrease in corporate leverage, leading to the twin-balance sheet problem. Maximum stress was \\nin the industry and infrastructure sectors.\\n2.30\\t The Government has paid close attention to resolving stress in banks and corporations \\nover the past decade. Measures such as strengthening the banking regulatory framework, \\namending the recovery laws, enacting comprehensive insolvency and bankruptcy legislation, \\nand establishing a public sector asset reconstruction company were implemented. These \\nmeasures have nursed the credit sector back to sound health, and the GNPA ratio shrunk to 2.8 \\nper cent in March 2024. \\n2.31\\t The emergence of stress in the market due to the operation of market forces and the \\nsubsequent business/venture failures is a sign of an active and dynamic economy. Since banks \\nform the most significant and predominant source of finance for businesses in India, banks \\nneed to be equipped to deal with the flow of distressed assets, and the markets need to be \\nequipped to channel investments into the reconstruction and revival of such assets. \\n2.32\\t Banking regulations provide for monitoring and timely identification of stressed assets, \\nand RBI has taken several measures to strengthen its prudential framework. Regulations also \\nprovide measures to address stress at its initial stages through restructuring and rescheduling \\nloans.

During FY23, around 45 \\nper cent of the reduction in GNPAs of SCBs was contributed by recoveries and upgradations.18 \\n2.34\\t The Asset Reconstruction Companies (ARCs)19 regulated under the SARFAESI Act are \\nemerging as an alternative channel for investors, including FPIs , to access the NPAs/distressed \\nassets held by banks. During FY23, 28 ARCs were operating in the market.20  Such acquisition is \\ndone by issuing security receipts (SRs), and ARCs are mandated to take at least 15 per cent of the \\nSRs issued or 2.5 per cent of the total SRs issued, whichever is higher. The regulatory framework \\nhas allowed the ARCs to participate as resolution applicants under the IBC process subject to \\ncertain conditions. It has thereby allowed  harnessing the synergies and complementarities \\nof the two market channels of asset reconstruction. During FY23, 9.7 per cent of the previous \\nyear’s stock of SCBs’ GNPAs was sold to ARCs, compared to only 3.2 per cent in FY22. The \\nnumber of SRs ultimately redeemed increased during FY23, indicating enhanced recovery \\nthrough this mode.\\n2.35\\t The prerequisites for an efficient market for the NPAs are that it should be deep, \\ncompetitive and have adequate liquidity. The market has to have enough investors to ensure \\nthat the price discovery of the NPAs is efficient. It has to have adequate liquidity to support \\nacquisition from the banks and support asset’s turn-around. Apart from direct measures taken \\nto reduce the GNPAs, the Government is building systemic strength in the market with market-\\nbased interventions to improve liquidity and competition by establishing a bad bank and \\nencouraging the insolvency and bankruptcy ecosystem.    \\n2.36\\t The Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) has implemented several measures \\nto improve liquidity in the market for distressed assets. FPIs are permitted to invest in \\ndebt instruments issued by companies undergoing resolution and in SRs issued by ARCs. \\nNo minimum investor limit or residual maturity requirement is imposed on FPIs for these \\ninvestments. These measures have led to an increase in FPI investment in SRs issued by ARCs \\nfrom around ₹10,000 crore to ₹14,482 crore during FY2221.

The India Debt Resolution Company Ltd (IDRCL) has an \\nexclusive arrangement with NARCL to resolve assets acquired by the latter. The IDRCL is \\nmandated to identify the appropriate resolution strategy for the asset and to aid NARCL in \\noptimal resolution outcomes. The assets acquired by the NARCL clear the bank balance sheets \\nimmediately, freeing capital for further lending.\\n2.38\\t NARCL has so far acquired 18 accounts with loan exposure of around ₹92,000 crore22, \\nwhich includes the acquisition of the ailing Srei Infrastructure Finance Ltd and Srei Equipment \\nFinance Ltd as resolution applicants.

The establishment of a government-backed company for the aggregation \\nand resolution of distressed assets will further improve liquidity and competition in the market. \\nAddressing distressed assets through insolvency resolution \\n2.39\\t The IBC has been recognised as an effective solution for the twin balance sheet problem, \\nwhere banks are under the stress of NPAs while corporates are overleveraged and unable to \\nrepay their debt. The Code provides for addressing financial distress early in time. It mandates \\nthe insolvency professional to conduct the insolvency process and run the operations of the \\ndistressed corporate debtor. At the same time, the committee of creditors steers the resolution \\nprocess and all significant decisions, thus reducing further erosion of value during the process \\nitself. By design and operation, the Code balances the needs of all stakeholders. IBC has provided \\nan avenue for corporate debtors to resolve their debt and get an honourable exit from failed \\nbusiness endeavours, thus promoting ease of doing business and encouraging entrepreneurship. \\nThe Code has established itself as an effective solution for addressing banks' stress by aiding \\nin significantly reducing GNPAs and helping rescue failing corporate debtors. It has offered \\nfresh impetus to the recovery segment of the financial markets and the reconstruction of \\nfailed/distressed assets in the real sector.  In the eight years since 2016, 31,394 corporate \\ndebtors involving a value of ₹13.9 lakh crore have been disposed of (including pre-admission \\ncase disposals) as of March 2024. The loss of control immediately after admission into the \\nresolution process has led debtors to settle with creditors as soon as the applications are filed \\nwith the National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT).

This provided a dedicated grievance redressal mechanism to the \\naggrieved homebuyers and a means to rein in errant real estate contractors and companies. \\nSubsequent enactment of the IBC in the same year opened another channel and has been the \\nmost favoured among the three available remedies. As of March 2024, over 1500 real estate \\ncompanies were admitted into the insolvency resolution process under the IBC, accounting \\nfor 21 per cent of total admissions. One in four cases settled after admission was also from \\nthis sector. Of the 891 corporate debtors resolved, 133 were real estate companies, forming \\n15 per cent of the companies resolved.\\nInsolvency resolution of real estate companies posed a unique set of challenges for the \\nstandardised corporate insolvency process. Real estate companies have multiple projects \\nspread across geographies, projects at different stages of construction, and diversified \\nbusiness models. The large number of homebuyers across these projects meant claims from \\nthousands of homebuyers who needed to be included in the process. The judiciary, the \\nGovernment, and the market have recognised these difficulties and moved in cohesive steps \\nto improve outcomes for these projects. The availability of two new remedial routes led to \\ndiscord and friction in the system.\\nThe Insolvency Law Committee, in its March 201829  report took cognisance of the peculiarity \\nof the real estate sector. It recommended that the amount raised from homebuyers be \\nconsidered financial debt as it formed a significant contribution to finances raised and had \\nthe commercial effect of borrowing. This led to substantial changes in the CIRP by making \\nhomebuyers a distinguished class of creditors and a part of the Committee of Creditors, \\nenabling their direct participation in decision-making. A system to organise and derive \\ndecisions, through consensus of majority voting of the thousands of homebuyers, was also \\nworked out to introduce insolvency professionals as authorised representatives. Further \\namendments enabled insolvency to be initiated by a joint application of not less than 100 \\nallottees or not less than 10 per cent of the total number of allottees under the same project, \\nensuring that frivolous applications are not filed. As clarity emerged on the use of IBC as a \\nremedy for homebuyers, it was also laid out that resolution plans approved for real estate \\nprojects should necessarily be compliant with the RERA Act, thereby restoring primacy to \\nthe sectoral law and the sectoral regulator in its domain for optimal oversight of the sector.\\nBy way of innovation in economic law, the judiciary paved the way for solutions in resolving \\nreal estate corporate debtors. As a class of creditors, it enabled homebuyers to act as resolution \\napplicants. It approved what was termed a “reverse CIRP”, where the corporate debtor could \\ntake measures to complete the project even as the resolution process was underway. The \\njudiciary has allowed project-specific resolution plans, targeting the affected project alone \\nunder the same corporate debtor. This measure relieved the corporate debtors and allottees \\nof different projects, and the market has responded positively.\\n29\\t Ministry of Corporate Affairs report of the Insolvency Law Committee, March 2018, https://ibbi.gov.in/uploads/resources/\\nILRReport2603_03042018.pdf'),\n",

India is \\nlikely no exception. \\n2.83\\t Derivatives trading holds the potential for outsized gains. Thus, it caters to humans' \\ngambling instincts and can augment income if profitable. These considerations are likely \\ndriving active retail participation in derivatives trading. However, globally, derivatives trading \\nloses money for the investors, for the most part. Raising investor awareness and continuous \\nfinancial education is essential to warn them of the low or negative expected returns from \\nderivatives trading.

To leverage this transparency and rigour of equity \\nmarkets for social good, in the Union Budget of FY20, the Government proposed to initiate \\nsteps towards creating a SSE under the regulatory ambit of SEBI for listing social enterprises \\nand voluntary organisations working for the realisation of a social welfare objective so that \\nthey can raise capital as equity as well as, debt in the country.\\nNeed for Social Stock Exchange: The SSE aims to bridge the financing gap by providing \\nalternative fund-raising instruments for achieving socio-development goals. SSE is a \\nseparate segment of the existing stock exchange, which can help social enterprises like non-\\nprofit organisations (NPOs) and non-government organisations (NGOs) raise funds from \\nthe public through the stock exchange mechanism. In this way, SSE is expected to stimulate \\nthe ecosystem of outcome-driven philanthropy in India in a transparent and regulated \\nenvironment. SSE also offers a platform for constructive engagement of NGOs and other \\nenterprises working in the area of social projects related to health, education, livelihood \\ngeneration, etc., to directly raise funds from the private sector, corporate entities and \\nindividuals (including High Net Worth Individuals (HNIs)) and contribute to development \\ngoals. With the increasing global appetite for socially responsible investments, SSE bridges \\nthis gap and brings the capital markets closer to the masses for meeting various social \\nwelfare objectives.\\nOperationalisation of SSEs: The contributions towards the social sector projects listed \\non SSE are made through a unique security, known as Zero Coupon, Zero Principal (ZCZP) \\ninstrument as the nature of funding is akin to a donation and, as such, does not promise \\nany payment of coupon or return of the principal amount. To scale up this ecosystem, the \\nGovernment has recently extended tax exemption under section 80G of the Income Tax Act, \\n1961, to the contributions made through ZCZPs on SSE. Another noteworthy feature of\\nSSE is that fund-raising on this platform is tied to specific projects undertaken by eligible \\nNPOs. These NPOs are mandated to declare their year-wise milestones that are targeted to \\nbe achieved with funds raised from the public. In this regard, the SEBI (Issue of Capital and \\nDisclosure Requirements (ICDR)) Regulations, 2018 identifies broad activities for which \\nthese potential projects can be undertaken, in areas such as eradication of hunger, poverty, \\nmalnutrition, and inequality; promotion of healthcare, education, livelihood for rural and \\nurban poor; disaster management; and environmental sustainability, among others.\\nTo be listed on SSE, NGOs/NPOs must disclose their past social audit reports, verifying \\nproven expertise and commitment to executing social sector projects. As eligibility criteria, \\nthe regulatory framework requires that the NGOs/NPOs have at least 3 years of field \\nexperience in executing social sector projects.

Over the last few years, GIFT \\nIFSC has made great strides in achieving both of these objectives. The initiative is a shining \\nexample of India’s firm commitment to undertake deep, bold and ambitious financial sector \\nreforms to attract the global financial services business and gradually become a global leader in \\ninternational finance.  \\n2.88\\t The uniqueness of the IFSC as a distinct financial jurisdiction emanates from three \\nfundamental factors. First, the IFSC has been designated as a non-resident zone under the \\nForeign Exchange Management Act, which means that entities set up in the IFSC are outside \\nthe capital control restrictions and, therefore, can conduct business in any of the eleven notified \\nforeign currencies.62 Second, the IFSC has been brought under the regulatory purview of a \\ndedicated  and unified financial regulator, i.e. IFSCA (International Financial Services Centres \\nAuthority), which has been set up under an Act of Parliament. This regulatory intervention by \\nthe Government has significantly bolstered the attractiveness of IFSC among global investors \\nand financial institutions, as they now have to deal with only one Authority for all approvals \\nand licenses. Third, through successive Union Budgets, the Government has provided a \\nseparate tax regime for the IFSC, which is at par with what is available in other leading global \\nfinancial centres.

The contribution of GIFT IFSC in transforming \\nthe country's financial industry landscape can be better appreciated by looking at some key \\nbusiness activities in GIFT IFSC. \\n2.89\\t Banking sector: The Banking ecosystem in GIFT IFSC is rapidly evolving with a \\nhealthy mix of foreign and domestic banks, primarily catering to the foreign currency borrowing \\nrequirements of Indian corporates and public sector enterprises through external commercial \\nborrowing, trade finance, etc. Transactions under these heads, previously booked from foreign \\nfinancial centres such as Singapore, Dubai, Hong Kong, etc., are now being booked out of GIFT \\nIFSC.  As of March 2024, the total asset size of IFSC Banking Units (IBUs) crossed USD 60 \\nbillion, and the cumulative value of transactions undertaken by IBUs crossed USD 795 billion.63 \\n2.90\\t Funds Industry: The robust funds industry in GIFT IFSC has a transformative impact \\nin catalysing global capital inflows into India, including the start-up ecosystem. In the last three \\nyears, there has been rapid growth in Fund Management Entities (FMEs) and AIFs registered \\nwith IFSCA. As of March 2024, the cumulative FMEs and funds registered rose from 39 and \\n33 as of September 2022 to 114 and 120, respectively, as of March 2024. Previously, the \\npooling of international capital for investments in India was structured through funds (private \\nequity, venture capital, hedge funds, etc.) set up in offshore jurisdictions. Now, with enabling \\nregulations, a competitive tax regime, and beneficial cost of operations, GIFT IFSC is emerging \\nas a preferred jurisdiction for the pooling of global capital by foreign and Indian fund managers.\\n2.91\\t Aircraft & ship leasing and financing: The aviation industry in India is on the cusp \\nof unprecedented growth, with a strong order book of more than 1500 + aircrafts placed by \\nIndian airlines and a projected demand for over 2,200 aircrafts by 2042. Currently, most aircraft \\noperated by Indian airlines are leased from offshore lessors that have access to competitive \\ncapital costs. The aircraft leasing and financing business, the most profitable segment in the \\naviation value chain, was entirely residing in foreign jurisdictions. Recognising the immense \\npotential of the aircraft leasing and financing business, IFSCA introduced the enabling leasing \\nframework, and the Government supported the endeavour by providing several tax incentives. \\nIn three years, green shoots have been visible in IFSC, with more than 28 aircraft lessors already \\nregistered, which have leased more than 120 + aviation assets, including commercial aircraft, \\nhelicopters, aircraft engines and ground support equipment. Interestingly, Air India has also \\ncommenced leasing its wide-bodies aircraft from the IFSC Zone.  \\n2.92\\t Considering the critical role of the maritime and shipping industry, the Government and \\nIFSCA have taken significant steps to develop a robust ship leasing and financing ecosystem \\nin GIFT IFSC. The initial focus is to bring back Indian shipping companies who are leasing/\\nowning ships out of foreign jurisdiction. With an enabling regulatory framework, the ship \\nleasing ecosystem is gaining traction. As of 31 March 2024, the number of ship leasing \\ncompanies registered with IFSCA has risen to 11, underscoring the financial centre's rising \\nappeal for maritime business.

In the recent past, the re-emergence of inflation has also damaged the \\ncommunity’s confidence in the ability of pension programs to deliver adequate retirement \\nbenefits over the longer term. Although inflation has declined in some economies, its persistence \\nhas highlighted this risk to current and future retirees. At the same time, there is an ongoing \\nglobal shift away from defined benefit (DB) to defined contribution (DC) arrangements, in which \\nindividuals carry all risks relating to investment returns, inflation and, often, longevity.

The decline in stress indicators has been broad-based, except for the NBFC and money \\nmarket segments. The decline in government debt market stress was the primary contributor \\nto the improvement in the overall FSSI, aided by a fall in long-term yields as well as volatility \\nand higher net foreign portfolio debt inflows. Meanwhile, declining volatility and rangebound \\nmovement in the exchange rate reduced stress levels in the foreign exchange market. Money \\nmarket stress indicators inched up as tight liquidity in the banking system led to higher interest \\nrates on money market instruments (e.g., Commercial Papers and Certificate of Deposits).

As a result, FY22 and FY23 witnessed price pressures in core \\nconsumer goods and services. Food prices were affected by adverse weather conditions \\nin the last two years. The net impact of these developments was elevated inflationary \\npressures in FY23 and FY24. Prudent monetary policy response and calibrated trade \\npolicy measures by the Government, coupled with strong output growth, helped reduce \\ncore inflation to a four-year low in FY24.

The review also showed that the recent pace of deceleration in core goods \\nprices closely matches the previous cases, while at the same time, the price growth in services \\nhas been more stubborn than it was in past inflation episodes. The persistent nature of \\nservice inflation is because of the much higher labour intensity in services.

Global trade patterns are reconfiguring. In 2023, Mexico became \\nthe largest goods trade partner of the US, surpassing China and Canada, with a total trade of \\nUSD 798 billion.4 Vietnam’s trade with China and the US has recently seen an increase. US \\nimports from Vietnam more than doubled from USD 46 billion in 2017 to USD 114 billion in \\n2023. During the same time, Vietnam’s imports from China rose from USD 58 billion to USD \\n111 billion.5 In another instance, European economies are shifting their energy imports from \\nRussia to Norway and the US. EU’s pipeline gas imports from Russia declined from 150.2 billion \\ncubic meters in 2021 to 42.9 billion cubic meters in 2023. During the same time, its pipeline \\ngas imports from the US rose from 18.9 billion cubic meters to 56.2 billion cubic meters.6 \\nThese shifts reflect the emergence of new practices in international trade such as ‘decoupling’, \\n‘derisking’, ‘reshoring’, ‘nearshoring’, and ‘friend sharing’ and the growing narrative of de-\\nglobalisation.7  \\n4.5\\t\\nHowever, there is an argument that while the growth of trade as a percentage of GDP \\nhas stalled since the global financial crisis, the slowdown of global trade seems a natural \\ndevelopment following its earlier fast growth (Chart IV.2).8 The de-globalisation trends are \\nhighly heterogeneous across countries. While the US and China are gradually decreasing their \\nreliance on global markets, this does not seem true for the rest of the world.9 Research by \\nthe Bank for International Settlement (BIS) shows that despite its policies, the US remains \\nreliant on Chinese inputs. In fact, the rise in trade through Mexico and Vietnam is a result of \\nChinese firms re-routing their supply through these countries (or by locating themselves in \\nthese countries). Further, China’s overwhelming dominance in the supply of processed critical \\nminerals and materials for energy transition renders a true decoupling between the two nations \\nneither easy nor likely. \\n4.6\\t\\nAs can be seen in Chart IV.1, global trade volume contracted by 1.2 per cent in 2023 after \\nrecording a 3 per cent expansion in 2022 following the outbreak of the Russia-Ukraine conflict.10 \\nThe value of world merchandise trade fell by 5 per cent in 2023, indicating the effect of lower \\nprices. This decline was offset mainly by a substantial increase in trade in commercial services, \\nwhich rose by 9 per cent to USD 7.5 billion in 2023.

Although other countries with GCC \\npresence have emerged recently, India remains a GCC favourite in a highly competitive \\nglobal environment due to its ample talent endowment and cost advantage.\\nThe way forward: Today, GCCs contribute to their parent organisations’ success and \\npropel India’s economic growth. They account for more than 1 per cent of the country’s GDP, \\nand the share is expected to grow further.44 As more global players eye India to set up their \\nGCC operations, the government has a crucial role in facilitating their entry.

This led to exponential gains in trade, reductions in supply chain costs \\nand deep interlinkages in trade across nations. A dramatic shift from “hyperglobalisation” to \\n“slowbalisation”46  occurred following the 2008 global financial crisis (GFC). Concerns about \\nthe risks and uncertainties surrounding GVCs were further amplified with shocks such as the \\nChina-USA trade war, the COVID-19 pandemic, and the Russia-Ukraine conflict. More recently, \\nthis trend has begun to see a reversal. WTO’s GVC Development Report 202347 showcases \\nrecovery in GVCs, underscored by a rise in the share of foreign export inputs and enhanced \\nparticipation rates of economies worldwide. \\n4.27\\t In line with the global trend, India’s GVC participation rose steadily through the 1990s \\nand 2000s before the GFC, after which it started declining. For instance, the foreign value-\\nadded content of India’s exports rose from 10 per cent in 1995 to 22 per cent in 2009 (the second \\nhighest amongst BRICS nations, after China), reflecting increased fragmentation of production \\nand integration into GVCs.48 After the lull seen in the years succeeding the global financial crisis, \\nIndia’s GVC participation has begun to rev up again on the back of incentives provided through \\nschemes such as the PLI and Districts as Exports Hub (DEH) initiative.

Key \\nevents include Vanijya Saptah, a series of workshops aimed at educating and empowering \\nlocal exporters, and participation in the Dubai Expo 2020, where Indian products were \\nshowcased to a global audience. A notable success of the expo is the introduction of Ladakh's \\napricots to Dubai supermarkets.

The CEPA is expected to increase the bilateral trade in goods to USD 100 billion within \\nfive years of the signing and increase trade in services to USD 15 billion. The India-UAE CEPA \\nis likely to benefit about USD 26 billion worth of Indian products that are subjected to 5 per \\ncent import duty by the UAE. UAE can also become a hub for sourcing India’s capital goods \\nand intermediates for further value-added exports to other African and European destinations. \\nAlso, for the first time in any Trade Agreement, a separate Annex on pharmaceuticals has \\nbeen incorporated to facilitate access to Indian pharmaceutical products, especially automatic \\nregistration and marketing authorisation in 90 days for products approved by developed \\ncountry regulators, namely the United States (USFDA), the United Kingdom (UKMHRA), the \\nEuropean Union (EMA), and Japan (PMDA).\\n4.38\\t Further, India has included digital trade within the ambit of its FTA with UAE for the \\nfirst time, which will help leverage India’s advantage in digital payment and e-commerce \\nservices.

One \\nfactor exacerbating this trend is the growing prevalence of non-equity modes of international \\nproduction, such as contract manufacturing, third-party outsourcing or franchising. Under \\nthese scenarios, while economies may become more integrated into GVCs, this may not be \\nreflected in the FDI data. During the pandemic, there was a surge in the share of digital services \\nin total FDI owing to the prevalence of work-from-home culture and the availability of efficient \\ndigital infrastructure. As a result, the share of digital FDI in total FDI rose from 46.6 per cent \\nin FY17 to 69.2 per cent in FY21. However, both digital and physical FDI have been falling in \\nrecent times.

However, this may be different across the board.

This shift is primarily \\ndue to disruptions caused by COVID-19, growing tensions between the US and China, and \\nrising costs of doing business in China. As a result, several companies have adopted a ‘China \\nplus one strategy’ to reduce their reliance on China for high-tech electronic products and \\ncomponents. This approach involves supply chain decisions to decrease their risk exposure \\nto China. For example, over 90 per cent of manufacturers in North America surveyed by the \\nBoston Consulting Group in 2023 moved some or all of their production to other countries \\nlike Mexico, Thailand, and Vietnam, suggesting a move away from China.102 \\nCan India benefit from this 'China plus one' strategy? The appeal of India lies in its large \\ndomestic consumer market, which makes it attractive for companies to set up operations \\nthere. In the electronics sector, there is a focus on smartphone manufacturing and assembly. \\nThe Government's PLI scheme, including tax breaks and subsidies, plays a significant role in \\nattracting companies. The rise in India's domestic smartphone demand is also a key factor \\nin companies' decisions to invest there. For instance, Apple assembled USD 14 billion worth \\nof iPhones in India during FY24, constituting 14 per cent of its global iPhone production.103 \\nFoxconn has started production of Apple mobile phones in Karnataka and Tamil Nadu.104 \\nWhile India may not be an immediate beneficiary of the trade diversion from China, it has \\nwitnessed a substantial increase in its electronic exports over time. The implementation of \\nthe PLI scheme has been a key driver of this growth. For instance, India's electronic exports \\nto the US have transitioned from a trade deficit of USD 0.6 billion in FY17 to a trade surplus \\nof USD 8.7 billion in FY24, underscoring a significant increase in value addition. Within the \\nelectronics sector, the category that has experienced the most growth is mobile phones, with \\nexports to the US rising from USD 2.2 billion in FY23 to USD 5.7 billion in FY24.\\nAs India looks to deepen its involvement in Global Value Chains (GVCs), it will look to the \\nsuccesses and strategies of East Asian economies.

Given that \\nGVCs are designed to minimise costs, countries like Malaysia, Vietnam, and Taiwan have \\nfocused on lowering their trade costs over time. For India, improving logistical efficiency \\nhas been a key focus, as evidenced by a noticeable rise in India's score on the World Bank's \\nLPI (as discussed in para 4.49). The second strategy, focused on investment facilitation, \\nincludes actions to increase and stabilise foreign investment. The PLI scheme, for example, \\nencourages high-quality foreign investment by offering a market-linked incentive system for \\ncompanies to comply with.\\nOver the medium term, India is focusing on integrating its value chain with that of the West, \\nparticularly in sectors like renewable energy and advanced technology, including artificial \\nintelligence, semiconductors, and next-generation telecommunications. This strategy is \\nbeing pursued through agreements such as the Australia-India Free Trade Agreement and \\nthe US-India Clean Energy Initiative. As a result, the trading patterns within these sectors \\nare starting to develop. For example, the tariff classifications for environmentally friendly \\ntechnology, such as solar water heaters, waste recycling devices, and wind turbines, show \\nan increase in exports to the USA from USD 199.2 million in FY20 to USD 326.9 million \\nin FY24105. Further, leading American and European companies in the renewable energy \\nsector, such as First Solar, Vesta, and Scatec, have established their operations in India to \\ntake advantage of the growing demand for green technologies. \\nWill China plus one result in a total movement of trading relations away from China? This \\nmay not be the case. Take, for example, nations like Mexico, Vietnam, Taiwan and Korea, \\nwhich were direct beneficiaries of the US’s trade diversion from China. Even while these \\nnations increased their share of exports to the US, they also displayed a concomitant rise in \\nChinese FDI.106 Therefore, the world cannot completely look past China, even as it pursues \\nChina plus one.\\nIndia faces two choices to benefit from China plus one strategy: it can integrate into China's \\nsupply chain or promote FDI from China. Among these choices, focusing on FDI from China \\nseems more promising for boosting India's exports to the US, similar to how East Asian \\neconomies did in the past. Moreover, choosing FDI as a strategy to benefit from the China \\nplus one approach appears more advantageous than relying on trade. This is because China \\nis India's top import partner, and the trade deficit with China has been growing. As the US \\nand Europe shift their immediate sourcing away from China, it is more effective to have \\nChinese companies invest in India and then export the products to these markets rather \\nthan importing from China, adding minimal value, and then re-exporting them.

The Marshal \\nLerner conditions, if met, suggest that currency depreciation can stimulate an increase \\nin net exports by reducing export costs and increasing import prices. This ‘trade’ channel \\nof the exchange rate has been well-documented for India. However, the exchange rate \\nalso influences the external sector through a ‘financial’ channel. Theory suggests that the \\nfinancial channel of the exchange rate can potentially counterbalance the gains (or losses) \\nmade through the trade channel. \\nA weak Rupee can affect the Balance of Payments (BoP) by changing the supply and cost \\nof foreign funding. For instance, depreciation can reduce the creditworthiness of local \\nborrowers if they have Rupee-denominated assets and borrow in foreign currencies. This \\ncould raise the cost of foreign lending and lead to a net capital outflow. Globally, appreciation \\nin domestic currencies (against the dollar) has increased cross-border banking capital flows.110 \\nHowever, Kearns and Patel (2016) show that the financial channel of the exchange rate is \\ngenerally more potent in EMEs, where unhedged foreign currency exposures are more likely \\nto be present.111\\n109  \\x07NEER is the weighted average of bilateral nominal exchange rates of the home currency in terms of foreign currencies.

Therefore, in the context of India’s large and growing \\nfinancial account with the rest of the world, whether the Rupee should remain competitive \\nis a question to ponder. \\nTo answer this question, the two different channels of the exchange rate were estimated \\nusing a trade-weighted exchange rate and a debt-weighted exchange rate. The trade-\\nweighted Nominal effective exchange rate (NEER) provided by the RBI is used to capture the \\ntrade channel. The financial channel is captured by a debt-weighted exchange rate (DWER), \\nwhich is constructed as an arithmetic average of the Rupee against major foreign currencies, \\nweighted by their share in the composition of external debt.\\nIn theory, the net BoP must equate to zero as trade surpluses (deficits) equate to capital \\naccount deficits (surpluses). However, in practice, countries report net Bop deficits/surpluses \\nwith rare instances of BoP equilibrium. Literature explains BoP disequilibria as a monetary \\ndisequilibrium and as the result of excess supply or demand for currency.113 Therefore, to \\nstudy the extent to which the two channels (trade and financial) counteract the other in the \\npresence of currency movement, the dependent variable used here is net BoP. \\nAn auto-regressive distributed lag (ARDL) model is deployed to capture the separate channels \\nof a Rupee depreciation/appreciation on net Balance of Payments (BoP). The problem of \\nendogeneity is controlled for in an ARDL framework in the absence of autocorrelation of \\nerrors.

The coefficients δi  and \\nβi indicate the elasticity of net BoP to changes in the debt channel of the exchange rate \\nand the trade channel of the exchange rate. Xt includes control variables such as World \\nimports, repo rate, commodity prices, domestic demand, GDP deflator and a dummy for the \\nCOVID-19 years (March 2020 to March 2022).

The structural \\nreforms undertaken by the Government of India since 2014 have put the economy \\nfirmly on a growth path, and India is soon set to become the third-largest economy in \\nthe world. In the medium term, the Indian economy can grow at a rate of 7 per cent \\nplus on a sustained basis if we can build on the structural reforms undertaken over the \\nlast decade. Against this backdrop, the chapter identifies the areas of key policy focus \\nas well as presents a six-pronged growth strategy to achieve this goal. The strategy \\nelucidated in the chapter is premised on the understanding that the structural reforms \\nof the last decade, focused on the supply side of the economy, have to give way to next-\\ngen reforms that are bottom-up in nature to yield strong, sustainable, balanced, and \\ninclusive growth. \\nSETTING THE CONTEXT \\n5.1.\\t\\nIn 1993, the Indian economy was valued at less than USD300 billion in dollar terms at \\ncurrent prices. Fast forward to 2024, and it is estimated to have reached a staggering USD 3.6 \\ntrillion. This represents a remarkable 12-fold increase despite the Indian rupee depreciating by \\naround 3 per cent annually between 1993 and 2024. Moreover, this has been achieved without \\na big rise in the country’s overall indebtedness, indicating an efficient utilisation of capital. \\nIndia’s per capita current dollar GDP has increased from 301.5 in 1993 to 2,484.8 in 2023,1 \\nwhich indicates a substantial improvement in the standard of living. \\n5.2.\\t\\nIndia is a historical and long civilisation. It provided answers to many questions that \\nhumankind faced and still faces. It is a country with a big land mass and a huge population. It \\nrightly aspires to be reckoned with as a great power in economic and other terms. China, India’s \\nneighbour to the Northeast and a nation of comparable size and population and antiquity of \\ncivilisation as India, has grown to become a major global economic and political power in less \\nthan a generation. India, too, has now set for itself the goal of becoming a developed nation \\nwithin a generation by 2047, the hundredth year of independence. \\n1  World Bank, 2023 (https://tinyurl.com/yeksmbde)\"),\n",

We have arrived at a multipolar world. \\nIt is more difficult than the bipolar world that we were used to for nearly five decades after \\nthe War ended. Therefore, mini and significant geopolitical conflicts are likely in the coming \\ndecades. \\n5.4.\\t\\nAt a cultural level, the rise of what is called the ‘Far Right’ by mainstream media in \\nadvanced nations is, in effect, a clash of priorities between globalist elites and others whose \\nfortunes are bound by and tied to their national geographies. This clash of priorities transcends \\neconomics. It includes cultural and social preferences and values. Therefore, along with \\neconomic stagnation and geopolitical conflicts, societies in advanced nations are fracturing \\nfrom within, too. The literature analysing long political, social, and civilisational cycles has \\nwarned us of a fairly to severely turbulent three decades until the middle of the century.\\n5.5.\\t\\nThe idea of economic globalisation has run its course. It may not be reversed fully, but \\nit has peaked. It will continue to face obstacles as economic policies worldwide pivot to the \\npromotion of national champions for reasons too well-known to bear repetition here. Along \\nwith the peaking of globalisation, there is also a rethinking of the role of government in national \\neconomic strategy as inequality, poverty, and indebtedness have become pressing issues \\nin the aftermath of the Covid pandemic. The clamour for easy answers to these global and \\ngenerational challenges has provided an excuse for interventionist policies despite their poor \\nempirical record in achieving prosperous or more equal societies.\\n5.6.\\t\\nLastly, there is the crisis posed by climate change and global warming. Developed \\ncountries are pushing for a reduction in the emission of greenhouse gases into the atmosphere. \\nWith their policies having questionable effectiveness in achieving emission reduction in their \\nown countries, they are ramping up pressure on developing nations. Developing nations are \\nstruggling to restore economic growth and reduce poverty and debt in their countries, all of \\nwhich have been amplified by the COVID-19 pandemic. They lack both technology and financial \\nresources to undertake the necessary transition to cleaner fuels. Developed nations are generous \\nwith pledges and parsimonious in delivering on them. Further, there are huge uncertainties as \\nto the efficacy of drastic measures to combat climate change and their economic impact over \\nthe next half to a full decade. Slower growth, stagnation, or outright contraction might trigger \\nsocial unrest and exodus of people to the West.\\n5.7.\\t\\nThis is the global backdrop to India’s growth, prosperity, and superpower aspirations for \\nthe next quarter century. In contrast, during its rise, China did not face many of these challenges, \\nand even the ones they faced were fairly milder, in comparison. For realising India’s aspirations, \\ndespite the changed circumstances, a good place to start is to acknowledge and recognise that \\nthe terrain has changed to be able to traverse through it and reach the destination.\\n5.8.\\t\\nIndia has to sustain its economic growth rate over a quarter century and do it sustainably, \\nkeeping the environment and climate in mind. Water stress looms large, as does air pollution. \\nLife expectancy, much higher now than in the past, has stagnated in recent years.

With the digitalisation of the Indian economy, cybersecurity assumes a much \\nhigher degree of importance and urgency.

Fiscal resources have to increase without compromising on economic \\ngrowth. \\n5.9.\\t\\nThe capacity in terms of numbers and the capability of the State in terms of competence, \\nskills, and attitude are additional factors that would determine the outcomes of India’s \\neconomic and social goals. Economic policies have to be crafted in such a manner that they \\ndo not address issues narrowly or incompletely while rendering problems in other areas more \\nintractable. Goals for a higher share of renewable power with its implications for land usage \\nand dependence on inimical powers for resources are one example. The impact of farm sector \\npolicies on water security is another example. \\n5.10.\\t With the global backdrop described earlier likely to come in the way of India boosting its \\nexports at the same pace and level as East Asian countries and national security considerations \\nlikely to make foreign direct investment flows volatile year-to-year, India has to generate \\ndomestic resources mostly for its own investment and growth priorities. Geopolitics imposes \\nits ceiling on external deficit and, consequently, external financing.\\n5.11.\\t Against this background, the medium-term growth outlook for the Indian economy, \\nwhich will be detailed in this chapter, is premised on the following key tenets:\\n\\uf06c\\t\\nFirst, increasing geoeconomic fragmentation and the consequent resource \\nnationalism have significant growth-limiting impacts on countries. It has given \\nrise to a trade-off between efficiency and resilience that did not exist a decade earlier. \\nEnsuring the security of supply through building buffers and slack has replaced the ability \\nto operate at the frontiers of efficiency. ‘Just in case’ has replaced ‘Just in time’. \\n\\uf06c Second, a global trust deficit is driving countries to pursue policies focused \\non enabling them to become self-reliant and protect them from external shocks, \\nespecially in sectors of strategic importance. Therefore, the balance between inward-looking \\npolicies versus outward-looking policies needs to become more nuanced going forward;\\n\\uf06c Third, the integration of climate change strategies into national development \\npolicy and planning is not merely an environmental imperative but more, as \\nit impacts socio-economic stability, public health, banking, and public finances. Climate \\nchange imposes costs and requires policymakers to balance adaptation to climate change \\nand emission mitigation. It also necessitates a trade-off between energy security and \\neconomic development on the one hand and energy transition on the other.\\n\\uf06c\\t\\nFourth, for better and worse, technology is emerging as the biggest strategic \\ndifferentiator determining the economic prosperity of nations. Its productivity-\\nenhancing potential is beyond doubt, but the social impact of emerging technologies such \\nas Artificial Intelligence (AI) via labour market disruptions and labour displacement is \\nbarely understood.

Therefore, recognition and acceptance \\nof trade-offs have become more necessary than before for policymakers. \\n\\uf06c\\t\\nSixth, in the last decade (2014-2024), the Government of India has pursued big-ticket \\nreforms focused on restoring the health of the economy, elevating the potential growth \\nby relieving supply-side constraints and strengthening its capabilities, capable of fulfilling \\nthe growth aspirations of the people in the present and the Amrit Kaal. The next stage \\nis to ensure that these reforms are implemented correctly and this will require intense \\nengagement with state governments, the private sector, and civil society.

India’s workforce is estimated to be nearly 56.5 Crore, of which more than 45 per \\ncent are employed in agriculture, 11.4 per cent in manufacturing, 28.9 per cent in services, \\nand 13.0 per cent in construction2. While the services sector remains a major job creator, the \\nconstruction sector has been rising in prominence lately, driven by the government’s push \\nfor infrastructure. However, since construction jobs are largely informal and low-paid, there \\nis a need for avenues for the labour force leaving agriculture. Meanwhile, the manufacturing \\nsector employment creation has been subdued in the past decade due to the legacy of bad \\nloans and appears to have rebounded since 2021-22. According to UN population projections, \\nIndia’s working-age population (15-59 years) will continue to grow until 2044. The chapter on \\nEmployment (chapter 8) estimates that the Indian economy needs to generate nearly 78.51 lakh \\njobs annually in the non-farm sector to cater to the rising workforce. However, to create these \\nmany jobs, there is a need to create the conditions for faster growth of productive jobs outside \\nof agriculture, especially in organized manufacturing and services, even while improving \\nproductivity in agriculture. \\n5.14.\\t Skill gap challenge: Sixty-five per cent of India’s fast-growing population is under 35, \\nand many lack the skills needed by a modern economy3. Estimates show that about\\xa051.25 per \\ncent\\xa0of the youth is deemed employable. In other words, about one in two are not yet readily \\nemployable, straight out of college. However, it must be noted that the percentage has improved \\nfrom around 34 per cent to 51.3 per cent in the last decade4.

All of these call for the upgradation of agricultural technology, the application of \\nmodern skills in farm practices, enhancing agricultural marketing avenues, price stabilisation, \\nthe adoption of innovation in farming, lowering wastages in the use of fertiliser, water, and \\nother inputs, and improving the agriculture-industry linkages.

Raising financial resources for \\nclimate change adaptation and mitigation actions of this scale is an unprecedented challenge, \\nespecially given that India’s climate action has been largely financed through domestic resources \\nand the flow of international finance has been very limited. As per the Reserve Bank of India, \\nbridging this substantial funding gap necessitates allocating 2.5 per cent of India's annual GDP \\nto green finance. A 2022 report by the Climate Policy Initiative8 found that domestic sources \\naccounted for the majority of green finance in India, at 87 per cent and 83 per cent in fiscal \\nyears 2019 and 2020, respectively.

China’s manufacturing trade surplus has been ballooning since \\n2019 due to weak domestic demand and expanding industrial capacity. The mismatch \\nbetween domestic supply and demand in China has widened in the past few years, leading \\nto Chinese companies exploring additional markets overseas. This is leading to prices \\ncollapsing globally and driving other national producers out of business, especially in \\nproduct categories where China dominates. For instance, the poor performance of China’s \\nproperty sector since 2021 created significant overcapacity leading to a collapse in global \\nsteel prices, which now puts significant pressure on producers in India, Vietnam, Brazil, and \\nother countries. Estimates show that China’s steel product exports are surging again—by 27 \\nper cent so far in 2024—after 35 per cent growth last year.\\nChina’s dominance over a large number of product categories creates a risk of economic \\ncoercion, where the government restrains access to crucial inputs for political leverage. \\nThis is most evident in the case of the export of rare earth and critical minerals which are \\nof high priority in the green transition efforts of countries. China’s dominance also has \\nled to monopolistic practices which has considerably limited the space for new entrants \\nto emerge as new manufacturing powers. Recent research by Rhodium Group observes \\nthat “The Chinese government can encourage companies to partner together, merge and \\nconsolidate, coordinate to gain market shares, raise prices, restrict access to products where \\nthey already have substantial market power, or favour domestic firms in their suppliers and \\nclient networks.”\\nIt is also interesting to note that \"while China still needs to import high-tech products \\nfrom rich industrialized economies, it imports very few low-tech goods, where developing \\ncountries would have a comparative advantage. This is largely a result of deliberate policy \\ninterventions, which have intensified in recent years.\"\\nAll these above factors have together played a key role in constraining the manufacturing \\nsector of EMDEs. While EMDEs are resorting to import restrictions as a policy option to \\ndeal with the Chinese challenge, it is pertinent to note that some Chinese goods are so cheap \\nthat no amount of tariff can reduce their price competitiveness. Further, some Chinese \\nproducts can move past these restrictions without being noticed since they are packaged in \\nthird countries. Meanwhile, China has started retaliating against these import restrictions \\nwhich has further complicated the manufacturing landscape for EMDEs.

Developing countries will \\nhave to figure out a way of meeting the import competition from China and, at the same \\ntime, boosting domestic manufacturing capabilities, sometimes with the collaboration of \\nChinese investment and technology.\\nAs the Rhodium group research points out, Brazil and Turkey recently raised tariffs on the \\nimport of E-Vehicles from China but, at the same time, took steps to attract Chinese FDI in \\nthe sector.\\nIndia has a similar decision to make, given its large bilateral trade deficit with China.

India needs both banks and capital markets to provide the required finances \\nsourced from a sustained high level of household savings. An active corporate bond market \\nbecomes critical in this context. An efficient corporate bond market with lower costs and \\nquicker issuing time can offer an efficient and cost-effective source of longer-term funds for \\ncorporates. However, the size of the corporate bond market in India, scaled by GDP, remains \\nsmall compared to other major Asian emerging markets such as Malaysia, Korea, and China.13 \\nThe Indian corporate bond market lacks depth since it is dominated by highly-rated issuers and \\na limited investor base of domestic institutions.\\n5.21.\\t Tackling inequality: Globally, widening inequality is emerging as a crucial economic \\nchallenge confronting policymakers. The 2022 State of Inequality in India report14 observed that \\nin India, the top 1 per cent accounts for 6-7 per cent of the total incomes earned, while the top \\n10 per cent accounts for one-third of total incomes earned.

MSMEs are the backbone \\nof the Indian economy, contributing approximately 30 per cent of the country’s GDP, 45 per \\ncent of manufacturing output, and providing employment to 11 crore of India’s population19. \\nThe Government of India has been proactive in boosting the growth of the MSME sector, \\nthrough initiatives such as the allocation of  5 lakh crore Emergency Credit Line Guarantee \\nScheme (ECLGS) for businesses, including MSMEs; equity infusion of  50,000 crore through \\nthe MSME Self-Reliant India Fund; New revised criteria for the classification of MSMEs; \\nrollout of Raising and Accelerating MSME Performance (RAMP) programme with an outlay \\nof  6,000 crores over 5 years; Launch of Udyam Assist Platform (UAP) on 11.01.2023 to bring \\nthe Informal Micro Enterprises (IMEs) under the formal ambit for availing the benefit under \\nPriority Sector Lending (PSL)20. These initiatives have been formulated keeping in mind the \\nkey challenges the sector faces, primarily for access to timely and affordable credit. Important \\nthough it is, however, financing is only one of the key challenges that the sector faces.\\n5.26.\\t Going forward, for the Mittelstand to expand, deregulation is a vital policy \\ncontribution. That is why the revival or creation of institutional mechanisms for dialogue \\nwith states on required policy changes is essential. Much of the action has to happen at the \\nlevel of sub-national (state and local) governments. Physical and digital connectivity \\n(industrial and freight corridors), infrastructure upgrade and development, the \\nintroduction of bullet trains, and the manufacture of semiconductor chips will contribute \\nto the growth of the sector through the supply-chain network and the growth of ancillary \\nindustries that they catalyse, apart from the inspirational effects that projects such as building \\nsemiconductor fab and introducing a bullet train will have when they are operational. MSME \\nentrepreneurs also need training in critical areas of enterprise management, such as human \\nresource management, financial management, and technology.

Agriculture is at the nexus of three of \\nthe greatest challenges of the 21st century – sustaining food and nutrition security, adaptation \\nand mitigation of climate change, and sustainable use of critical resources such as water, energy, \\nand land. Agriculture and allied sectors such as horticulture, livestock, fisheries, and dairy and \\nactivities such as food processing hold significant potential for gainful employment. Given the \\ngeopolitical and technological threats that both manufacturing and service sectors face, it makes \\nimmense sense to do whatever it takes to realise the latent employment potential in agriculture. \\nIt is both urgent and important for India to re-imagine the contours of its primary sector for the \\nnext generation. India may have to abandon the old development playbook of moving on from \\nagriculture to industry and services as economic development matures. Far from fading away \\nwith economic development as has happened with other countries in the past, in the changed \\ngeopolitical and evolving climatic circumstances, it may have a very important role to play in \\nIndia’s physical, food, and economic security.\\nBox V.3: A farmer-friendly policy framework\\nThe Indian agriculture sector is a success story. The country has come a long way from being \\na food deficit and importing country in the Sixties to being a net exporter of agricultural \\nproducts. At the same time, it is important to recognise that India has a good scope to enhance \\nvalue addition in agriculture and make employment in agri-value chains both remunerative \\nand attractive among Indian youth. Unlike East Asian economies and developed countries of \\nthe West, India has yet to fully exploit the potential of agriculture to contribute to economic \\ngrowth and employment generation. \\nIndian agriculture is not in a crisis now but requires a serious structural transformation \\nbecause climate change and water criticality loom large in the times to come. The surge \\nin agricultural employment in Covid years due to reverse migration, the decline in the \\ngrowth rate of value addition in agriculture in FY24, and an extremely hot summer in the \\nNorthwestern and central regions of the country in the summer of 2024 with rising water \\nstress and energy consumption make a serious and honest stock-taking of India’s farm sector \\npolicies imperative. If we grasp the nettle, then the chances of enhancing the contribution of \\nthe farm sector to national food and nutritional security, as well as economic prosperity in \\nrural India, go up considerably.

Thus, agriculture has a much higher multiplier effect on overall GDP than indicated \\nby its direct contribution.\\nIn a growing economy, the share of agriculture declines over time. That is normal. That \\nis considered progress. Households, as their incomes rise, do not consume more food \\nproportionately. The share of food in their consumption expenditure goes down, famously \\nregarded as Engel’s law. However, it does not mean that food is less consequential to their \\nwell-being. Within food, the expenditure on nutritious food (protein and vitamins) such as \\nlivestock products (milk and meat), fish, fruits, and vegetables goes up, which is in line with \\nwhat is known as Benette’s law. \\nAgriculture and farmers matter for a nation. Most countries understand that. India is \\nno exception. India subsidises their water, electricity, and fertilisers. The former two \\nare provided virtually free. Their incomes are not taxed. The government offers them a \\nminimum support price (MSP) for 23 selected commodities. Monthly cash support is offered \\nto farmers through the PM-KISAN scheme. In the past and in some cases, even now, Indian \\ngovernments – national and sub-national – have waived their loans. So, governments in \\nIndia spend enough resources to look after the farmers well. Yet, a case can be made that \\nthey can be served better with some re-orientation of existing and new policies.\\nFarm products are doubtless subject to the interplay of market forces. If anything, the relative \\ninelasticity of food consumption works in their favour. This creates a conundrum. Prices rise \\nwhen weather or other factors adversely impact the harvest. Farmers respond by increasing \\nthe area under cultivation for the next year, leading to a glut in supply, which drags down \\nprices. On both occasions, farmers fail to reap any rewards – because of inadequate produce \\nin the first instance and lower prices in the second. \\nAnother risk for farmers is when output drops due to drought or drenching at harvest time. \\nPrices rise, but the farmer is unable to benefit from the produce because it is inadequate. \\nSo, farming needs insurance. The challenge is to figure out the best forms of insurance \\nand price support for farmers that do not distort incentives and create other costs for the \\neconomy, such as excessive water consumption, depletion of groundwater, soil quality \\nerosion, and, equally, health costs through indirect encouragement of excess consumption \\nof carbohydrates.\\nIn theory, this insurance can come in the form of price support or income support. Price \\nsupport interventions include direct price floors like the Minimum Support Price (MSP) or \\nprice-gap support like the Bhavantar Bhugtan Yojana that Madhya Pradesh experimented \\nwith in one season but gave up subsequently. Income support in the form of direct benefit \\ntransfers (DBT) like the PM KISAN is the preferred form of agriculture subsidy in many \\ndeveloped countries. Crop insurance, like the Prime Minister’s Fasal Bima Yojana (PMFBY), \\nis another form of income support, though it has a mixed record globally.  \\nGiven the vagaries of weather and the inherent difficulties of responding to prices promptly, \\nthere is an economic and moral case for farmers to be supported when market prices fail \\nthem. At the same time, farmers must have the freedom to benefit from market prices when \\nmarket prices operate in their favour.'),\n",

Therefore, in addition to \\nsupporting farmers, governments are forced to intervene in the market to stabilise prices \\nthrough policies like open market sales, trade controls, and measures against hoarding \\nand speculation. In India, these measures come on top of the massive Public Distribution \\nSystem (PDS) that underpins food security for the vast majority of the population, especially \\nthe poor and vulnerable.\\nHowever, such price stabilisation measures aimed at consumers often conflict with income-\\nsupport policies for the farmers. Governments have no option but to do a delicate balancing \\nact. Here, the combination of policies becomes important. It is about a basket of policies \\nthat serve the interests of both farmers and consumers. There is a strong case here that both \\nwith farmers and consumers, income top-ups, i.e., direct cash transfers, are more effective. \\nDirect transfers allow the markets to function.\\nHow do we let the markets function in the interests of the farmer? What can governments \\ndo?\\n(1) \\tBy not banning futures or options markets at the first sign of price spikes. \\nThese markets do not hurt consumers or farmers at all times. The bar for such bans \\nmust be set so high that their recourse must be almost non-existent. The intelligent \\nregulatory design of such markets can obviate the need for bureaucratic interference in \\nthe futures market for agricultural commodities. \\n(2) \\tBy invoking export bans only under exceptional circumstances and allowing \\ndomestic consumers to substitute, especially if the agricultural commodities in question \\nare not essential consumption items such as foodgrains. Even in those cases, the \\ngovernment can allow substitution effects to play out before responding to domestic \\nsupply concerns. For example, if sugar prices rise, consumers can consume less of it or \\nswitch to jaggery. It may even be a good thing for their health. In general, it is far easier \\nfor consumers to substitute or pare back consumption than for farmers to endure big \\nlosses because of ad hoc export bans or huge imports.\\n\\t\\nFarmers should be allowed to benefit from higher international prices. Bans on food \\nexports also need to be telegraphed in advance lest hunger and famine elsewhere in the \\nworld worsen.\\n(3) \\tBy re-examining the inflation-targeting framework. Food constitutes a very \\nhigh portion of the consumer price index in developing countries. That is par for the \\ncourse. Hence, when central banks in developing countries target headline inflation, \\nthey effectively target food prices. So, when food prices rise, inflation targets come \\nunder threat. Therefore, the central bank appeals to the government to bring down \\nthe increase in the prices of food products. That prevents farmers from benefiting \\nfrom the rise in terms of trade in their favour. India’s inflation targeting framework \\nshould consider targeting inflation, excluding food. Higher food prices are, more \\noften, not demand-induced but supply-induced. Short-run monetary policy tools are \\nmeant to counteract price pressures arising out of excess aggregate demand growth.'),\n",

Therefore, it is worth exploring whether India’s inflation targeting \\nframework should target the inflation rate excluding food. Hardships caused by higher \\nfood prices for poor and low-income consumers can be handled through direct benefit \\ntransfers or coupons for specified purchases valid for appropriate durations.\\n(4)\\t Specifically, with reference to India, by increasing the Total Net Irrigated Area. \\nSeveral states are well below the national average. Investment in irrigation may make \\nmonsoon-watching a non-event, but it would enhance farmers’ income security. Not \\nonly that, as in the case of power generation plants where the plant load factor has scope \\nfor improvement, India’s irrigation efficiency can also improve. It is only 30-40 per \\ncent for surface water and 50-60 per cent for groundwater. This calls for better water \\nutilisation farming practices and technologies like drip and fertigation. It will help raise \\nproductivity and cut down water and fertiliser use by almost 50 per cent. \\n(5) \\tBesides these, by making farming consistent with climate considerations. \\nIndia produces too much foodgrains and sugar, too few pulses, oil seeds, and other cash \\ncrops. Grains such as rice and sugarcane are water-guzzling crops. Water criticality is \\nescalating in India. Further, among foodgrains, the cultivation of paddy gives rise to \\nmethane emissions. Its methane emission potential is considerable. Sometimes, and \\nunder some conditions, Direct Seeded Rice (DSR) or even organic farming for some \\ncrops could help save water and chemical fertilisers. It is also important to recognise \\nthat India has achieved relative self-sufficiency in basic staples and has emerged as the \\nlargest exporter of rice in the world (almost 40 per cent of world exports in 2022-23). \\nExporting 20 MT of rice means at least exporting 40 billion cubic meters of water. At \\nhome, the Food Corporation of India currently has rice stocks that are more than three \\ntimes the buffer stock norm. Excessive production of rice results from large subsidies for \\npower for irrigation, water, and fertilisers. The time has come to promote ‘crop-neutral \\nincentive structures.’ That would imply that pulses, oilseeds, and millets that save on \\npower, water, and fertilisers need to be rewarded with equivalent subsidies embedded \\nin rice production. \\nFurther, the need of the hour is to move from basic food security to nutritional security. We \\nneed more pulses, millet, fruits and vegetables, milk and meat for that. Importantly, their \\ndemand is growing much faster than that of basic staples. So, farm sector policies should \\nalign more with a ‘demand-driven food system’ that is more nutritious and aligned with \\nNature’s resource endowments.  \\nIn sum, there is a need to take a holistic view of these diverse considerations, such that \\neconomic policies, in general, and farm policies, in particular, benefit farmers and are \\ncompatible with priorities related to health, water, and climate.\\nGiven India’s natural competitive advantages, agriculture and allied sectors have immense \\nscope to contribute to employment and economic growth.

There is also the need for \\ninnovative and tailored approaches to effectively channel funds into green finance. For instance, \\nblended finance, which strategically integrates public and private capital, holds the potential \\nto attract private sector involvement, mitigate investment risks, and enable the rapid and \\nscalable deployment of resources needed to successfully transition to a sustainable, low-carbon \\neconomy. Furthermore, as India shifts to low-carbon energy to meet its environmental goals, \\nsector-specific financial institutions can also help to mobilize green funds. Their specialized \\nknowledge of the sector (especially the hard-to-abate sector) enables them to create innovative \\nfinancial products tailored to transition projects’ unique requirements. By directing investment \\nto green initiatives, these institutions can drive the transition to cleaner energy, contributing \\nnot only to reducing carbon emissions but also to a more sustainable and resilient energy future. \\nThere is significant potential for enhancing the role of the International Financial Services \\nCentres Authority (IFSCA) which can act as a conduit for attracting international capital crucial \\nto fill India’s climate finance gap. The Report on Transition Finance by the Expert Committee \\non Climate Finance has submitted their recommendations which can provide a roadmap for \\nIFSCA to develop a climate finance ecosystem and instruments. India also can engage with \\nmultilateral development banks and explore the use of new and existing instruments that they \\nhave to offer to raise necessary finance which can be ploughed back into financing India’s green \\ntransition goals. \\nBox V.4: Leveraging Market Finance: India’s Catalytic Use of \\nMultilateral Investment Guarantee Agency (MIGA)\\nIndia’s economic trajectory towards higher middle-income status is reflected in how the \\ncountry is evolving in its use of development finance from the World Bank Group.

The commercial finance is being \\nexecuted through GIFT City in Gujarat, where MUFG has opened a centre. In addition, \\nMIGA provided credit enhancement guarantees to Citi, Standard Chartered Bank, and \\nCredit Agricole for their commercial loans totalingtotaling US$200 million, which was used \\nto partially replace an existing US$500 million IBRD loan to the State Bank of India (SBI). \\nThe IBRD loan was provided to SBI in 2016 as part of the Grid Connected Solar Rooftop22 \\nProgram to deliver rooftop solar systems to commercial and industrial customers across \\nIndia. \\nBoth operations reflect India’s commitment to a green, economic growth strategy.  The \\nfreight corridor is a much more efficient mode of transportation relative to road transport \\nand reduces millions of tons of greenhouse gas emissions (GHG) each year.  The SBI’s \\nfinancing of solar PV program provides clean, renewable energy and reduces greenhouse gas \\nemissions by displacing thermal generation.  For both programs, India used IBRD loans to \\nfinance the early phase of infrastructure development – allowing the operations to become \\ncommercially bankable – before replacing it with market financing backed by MIGA.  In \\neffect, IBRD investment helped the infrastructure investments cross the green-field risks, \\nmaking the MIGA-backed market financing competitive with IBRD and, at the same time, \\nallowing IBRD funds to be released for reinvestment in new development projects.   The \\nMIGA guarantee allowed DFCCIL to borrow internationally under commercial terms for the \\nfirst time, thereby diversifying the SOE’s financing options.  For SBI, the guarantees also \\nreduced its cost of borrowing and diversified its sources of funding.

However, skills are \\nacquired on the foundations built by the education system, especially at the schools. Therefore, \\nschooling should focus on the basic requirement of foundational literacy and numeracy and the \\nrealisation of grade-appropriate learning outcomes. The NEP 2020 and NEP 2023 provides a \\ngood framework to realise this objective. It serves as a stimulus for reforming the educational \\nsystem to increase the employability of the future generation. Implementing the NEP is key to \\nachieving educational outcomes and preparing the youth for participating in the knowledge \\neconomy.

The civil service's ability to design policies and ensure that initiatives \\nreach all citizens has been critical to the success of these programs. However, sustaining and \\naccelerating India's progress in the face of evolving challenges requires the state machinery \\nto reimagine, reinvent, reinvigorate, and re-equip itself. After eighty years of relative stability \\npost-WW II, it appears that convulsive change is in store in global affairs. It is unlikely to leave \\ntoo many areas untouched – diplomacy, security, and domestic socio-economic development. \\nAt senior levels, the country will need the combined wisdom, knowledge and experience of \\nboth the generalists and specialists. Civil Service provides the former and the private sector \\nthe latter. In recent years, the Government has made a significant beginning in lateral entry \\ninto the senior ranks of Central Ministries through a transparent process. This needs to be \\nsubstantially expanded. It is one way to plug the gap because the need for diverse skills and \\nmindsets will only keep expanding in the coming years. Foundational and mid-career training \\nfor civil servants in all specialities has to be re-imagined for the recharging and rebooting of \\nskills, aptitude and attitudes. Length of tenure too is critical to grow into the demands of, \\nand be productive and purposeful, in senior roles. Accountability mechanisms and practices \\nwill become necessary, if not already, to ensure policy outcomes at scale and speed. Annual \\nconversations on goals and measurement – at the beginning and the end of the year – at senior \\nlevels will usher in professionalism and accountability. While, in theory, the desirability of \\nsuch a practice is not in doubt, these mechanisms and practices will themselves require many \\niterations for a better understanding of their feasibility, limitations, and utility to evolve before \\nthey are institutionalised more permanently.\"),\n",

These included departments \\nimplementing policies in silos,23 poor communication, strict information boundaries, and \\nlack of collaboration which resulted in duplicate efforts and inefficient resource allocation.24 \\nUndergirding this structure was a personnel management system that hampered the capacity \\nand motivation of civil servants to work efficiently. Under-resourced training institutes \\nand infrequently updated training programs did not provide officials with the skills and \\nspecialisation they needed to grow professionally and meet the changing needs of public \\nadministration.25,26 Performance management systems were not equipped with the proper \\nmechanisms to assess, reward, and improve performance, and to align officials’ capacities \\nwith the needs of the system.27 Challenging work environments and lack of mentorship led \\nto reduced motivation to excel at work.28 \\nAddressing these problems has required looking beyond a single, definitive solution. In their \\nseminal paper on the challenges of policy-making in diverse societies, Rittel and Webber \\n(1973) propose that problems of public policy planning are ‘wicked’: they are inherently \\ncomplex, multi-faceted, and resistant to straightforward solutions.29 hey comprise multiple \\nsmaller problems and concern multiple actors, often with competing priorities. There is no \\nclear point at which a problem of this nature can be said to be solved and no ideal solution \\nfor it. The government has responded to the wicked challenge of building state capacity by \\nlaunching Mission Karmayogi, which deconstructs the problem into more tractable sub-\\ncomponents. The program endeavours to enhance state capacity using the ‘Workforce-\\nWork-Workplace’ framework to address each level of the civil service as well as the linkages \\nand interactions between them.30 It provides a multi-pronged solution encompassing:\\n\\uf06c\\t\\nBuilding the capacity of the Workforce centred on their roles and associated \\ncompetency requirements at multiple career stages \\n\\uf06c\\t\\nImproving the quality of the Work through role-based human resource management \\nand decision-making \\n\\uf06c\\t\\nEnhancing the Workplace through mentorship, better managerial practices, and \\nimproved physical infrastructure\\n23  First ARC, Report on Machinery of Government of India and its Procedures of Work, 1968, Chapter II, Section 2.2\\n24 \\x07 \\x07Second ARC, Twelfth Report on Citizen Centric Administration: The Heart of Governance, 2009, Chapter 2, \\nSection 2.6\\n25 \\x07Second ARC, Twelfth Report on Citizen Centric Administration: The Heart of Governance, 2009, Chapter 2, \\nSection 2.6\\n26  \\x07Second ARC, Tenth Report on Refurbishing of Personnel Administration – Scaling New Heights, 2008, Chapter \\n4, Section 4.1\\n27  ibid., Chapter 5, Section 5.2\\n28  ibid., Chapter 7, Section 7.4\\n29 \\x07\"Dilemmas in a General Theory of Planning,\" Horst W.

As officials evolve in their careers, the competencies \\nthey are required to possess also evolve. Through Mission Karmayogi, the government is \\ndelineating the competency requirements for all civil servants in terms of their roles and \\nduties, as well as the four Gunas or overarching virtues of civil servants as highlighted in the \\nKarmayogi Competency Model.31 Competencies then become a key tool for enhancing the \\nperformance of civil servants. Once competencies have been specified, they can be assessed \\nusing several measures, including workplace performance assessments, data from digital \\nMIS systems, and 360-degree feedback mechanisms. This would enable the government to \\nprovide calibrated capacity-building support and identify the right person for the right role \\nin government.\\nCapacity-building programmes, both in terms of pre-service training and ongoing professional \\ndevelopment, can be designed to build the specific competencies that a civil servant needs to \\nperform their role well. This also creates the space to expand beyond conventional training \\nprograms to draw on a range of approaches that are grounded in evidence-based adult \\nlearning principles, such as immersion programs, exposure visits, case studies (through the \\nuse of Amrit Gyaan Kosh32), and self-paced and technology-enabled learning. To achieve \\nthis at scale, technology-enabled capacity building will allow officials across cadres, states, \\nand seniority to steer their professional development. The iGOT Karmayogi platform is \\nrapidly shaping into a central node that enables civil servants to access tailored and need-\\nbased capacity-building modules, track their competency requirements and gaps, and share \\nknowledge and learnings across departments.\\nIn tandem with capacity building, Mission Karmayogi is also introducing a role-based \\nhuman resource management system that would allow the government to match civil \\nservants with roles based on the competencies they possess and the requirements of the \\nrole. Decision-making around postings, transfers, and promotions can then be guided by \\ncivil servants’ demonstrated competencies and experience. This is a significant shift from \\nthe current rule-based approach, which will generate better incentives for performance \\namong civil servants. Access to the universe of capacity-building resources - and not just \\nwhat is considered relevant for their level - will enable civil servants to proactively plan their \\nprofessional journeys within government in a manner that aligns with their areas of interest \\nand expertise.\\n31  \\x07The Karmayogi Competency Model is a public human resource management framework developed by the \\nCapacity Building Commission of India. The framework is built on four elements: self-awareness of one’s own \\nstrengths and weaknesses, collaboration and inclusion of diverse voices towards a shared goal, transparency and \\ncompliance with the rules and regulation as well as Knowledge of systems and processes, and citizen-centricity \\nand the motivation to transform citizens’ lives through one’s work.\\n32 \\x07Developed by the Capacity Building Commission of India, Amrit Gyaan Kosh is a dedicated knowledge bank for \\ncivil servants which houses teachable case studies, policy simulations, and interactive and immersive learning \\nresources.'),\n",

The country \\nhas weathered the onslaught of multiple global crises because the government dealt with them \\ndeftly by forging a recovery strategy that was uniquely designed to address the concerns of \\ncitizens while ensuring that the growth momentum continued to be sustained through a wide \\nrange of structural reforms. India’s strength has always been its institutions, and, many a time, \\nthe institutional strength has enabled the country to wade through multiple challenges. \\n5.33.\\t The structural reforms undertaken by the Government of India over the course of the \\nlast decade have put the economy firmly on a growth path, thanks to which India is soon set \\nto become the third largest economy in the world, following the US and China. In its April \\n2024 World Economic Outlook, the IMF has raised India's growth forecast for 2024-25 to\\xa06.8 \\nper cent\\xa0from 6.5 per cent on the back of strong domestic demand and a rising working-age \\npopulation, making India the fastest-growing G20 economy. It is in line with our expectations \\nfor economic growth, as mentioned in Chapter 1. India has graduated from being a low-income \\ncountry to a low-middle-income country. As it journeys further towards middle and upper-\\nmiddle-income status, aspirations of the people keep rising. Satisfaction with past progress \\nfades away from memory quickly, and newer expectations take their place. The measurement \\nof achievements in the present against rising aspirations leaves society appear restless and \\ndiscontented. But, this is creative and not destructive. The latent energy of such aspirations \\nneeds to be harnessed even as they have to be met. This has to be carried out in a country \\nof India’s size and within a democratic framework. There are no historical precedents and \\ntemplates to follow for the complexity it entails. What has brought the economy to its present \\nstate from where it was three decades ago may not take us to the next destination. Awareness \\nof the unique nature of India’s circumstances and its goals is necessary to prepare ourselves to \\nparticipate in and contribute to its socio-economic progress. Our knowledge and attitudes have \\nto continually evolve to keep up with the requirements that the project, ‘Viksit Bharat @2047’ \\nentails.

Three-mile island, Chernobyl \\nand Fukushima, loom large in people\\'s minds. Prof. Daniel Kahneman, who passed away earlier \\nthis year, would have chuckled.2  \\n6.4.\\t\\nRelatively common metals like copper and nickel are going to become scarcer. In \\'The \\nMaterial World\\', Ed Conway wrote that the world might need more copper in the next few \\ndecades than it has ever used since the metal was known to humans. Not just copper but other \\nmetals will also be in short supply. The price of energy transition will be too much for most \\nnations. It will only get worse. More importantly, extracting materials and minerals requires a \\ntremendous amount of energy. Analysts in JP Morgan wrote3, \"… just developing the forecasted \\nwind and solar capacities would require ~10EJ of energy during 2024-30, which is equivalent \\nto ~20% of our projected global energy demand growth over the same period (forecasts based \\non our Global Energy Outlook) and will emit ~1,450 mn tonnes of CO2e (~207 mn tonnes on \\naverage, equivalent to the annual emissions of Pakistan or Argentina in 2022). Additionally, \\nthe projected penetration of electric vehicles in the global light-duty vehicle fleet requires \\nanother ~10EJ of energy to build and charge these EVs.”\\n6.5.\\t\\nThe other factor is time. Nowhere in the world has energy transition of this scale \\nhappened within the short time envisaged. Vaclav Smil wrote in 2014,4\"… each widespread \\ntransition from one dominant fuel to another has taken 50 to 60 years…. Energy transitions \\non a national or global scale are inherently protracted affairs. The unfolding shift from \\nfossil fuels to renewable energy sources will be no exception. It will require generations of \\nperseverance.” In fact, he wrote that the more effective solution was to lower overall energy \\nuse. Alas, that is one advice that the world is either unable to or unwilling to heed. It is hard \\nto fault developing countries for not wanting to curb their energy consumption. It is morally \\nwrong to tell developing countries to abandon their aspirations for better living standards so \\nthat developed countries can maintain their ways of living in cleaner environments and cooler \\nclimates.\\n6.6.\\t\\nHowever, the Paris Agreement signed in December 2015 did precisely that.

The National \\nAction Plan on Climate Change (NAPCC)11  outlines the strategy to enhance the sustainability \\nof the country’s development path. Based on the principles of achieving high economic growth \\nwhile also improving the ecological sustainability of India's developmental path, NAPCC \\nincludes nine national missions covering solar, water, energy efficiency, forests, sustainable \\nhabitat, sustainable agriculture, sustaining the Himalayan Ecosystem, strategic knowledge for \\nclimate change, and the recently added mission on human health. A broad spectrum of climate \\naction - adaptation and mitigation, including demand side management - is being taken through \\nthe programme. States and Union Territories (UTs) have been encouraged to prepare their \\nState Action Plan on Climate Change (SAPCC) consistent with strategies in the NAPCC.  So far, \\n34 SAPCCs are operational, laying out sector-specific and cross-sectoral, time-bound priority \\nactions for the state. \\n6.16.\\t India has made significant progress on climate action. The addition to the installed solar \\npower capacity was 15.03 GW in 2023-24, reaching a cumulative of 82.64 GW on 30 April \\n2024.12 Under the National Mission on Enhanced Energy Efficiency, the eighth cycle of the \\nPerform Achieve and Trade (PAT) scheme13 was notified in June 2023 for the period 2023-\\n24 to 2025-26 and covers sectors like Aluminium, Cement, Chlor-Alkali, Iron & Steel, Pulp \\n& Paper, and Textile with a total energy saving target of 0.3370 MTOE (million tonnes of oil \\nequivalent). The PAT scheme in its various cycles has resulted in a significant amount of energy \\nsavings and a reduction in greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions (Box 2).\\n6.17.\\t As a result of the coordinated action, most targets of the first NDC were achieved well in \\nadvance. For instance, the country achieved 40 per cent cumulative electrical power installed \\ncapacity from non-fossil fuel-based energy sources in 2021 and reduced the emission intensity \\nof India’s GDP from 2005 levels by 33 per cent in 2019– nine and eleven years before the \\ntarget year of 2030, respectively. The NDC was further updated in August 2022.14  The target to \\nreduce the emissions intensity of India’s GDP was enhanced to 45 per cent (from the earlier 33-\\n35 per cent) by 2030 from the 2005 level, and the target on cumulative electric power installed \\ncapacity from non-fossil fuel-based energy resources increased to 50 per cent (earlier 40 per \\ncent) by 2030.

The Government of \\nIndia has taken several initiatives to address this. Much of the emphasis in the NAPCC has been \\non adaptation, with seven of the nine missions addressing it. Further, the promotion of micro \\nirrigation under the Pradhan Mantri Krishi Sinchayee Yojana (PMKSY), the introduction of \\nthe National Innovations on Climate Resilient Agriculture (NICRA) to enhance the resilience \\nof Indian agriculture to climate change and climate vulnerability through strategic research \\nand technology demonstration, flood forecasting and early warning system, etc. are some \\nsignificant initiatives in this direction.

This reflects the importance that the Government is placing on adaptation action and, \\nat the same time, is reflective of the significant pressure on domestic resources.

Over the years, due to farming practices, the village's water table decreased to 500-\\n600 feet below the ground level. Total Dissolved Salt (TDS), ranging from 900 to 1100 mg/\\nlitre, made the water unsuitable for agriculture. Due to these reasons, farming became a loss-\\nmaking profession for the farmers. Farmers could only produce one conventional crop like \\ncotton & castor. The Water Resource Department, Gujarat, and Gujarat Green Revolution \\nCompany (GGRC) mobilised local farmers to rejuvenate the village pond by drawing water \\nfrom the nearby sub-minor canal of the Guhai Dam. \\nThe village farmers’ co-operative society under the ‘Som Sarovar’, deepened the village \\npond with the help of the Gram Panchayat to store and conserve water. The farmers built \\na sump (40 ft diameter x 40 ft depth), drew water from the village pond, took individual \\nelectricity connections, and installed water lifting facilities (pump & motor) from the sump. \\nThe farmers bore the total cost of electrical connections and pumping/lifting of water. \\nFarmers also created the piped water conveyance from the sump to their respective fields. \\nThe farmers’ body made it compulsory for all the member farmers to adopt drip irrigation for \\nefficient water use under Per Drop More Crop (PDMC).

The Montreal Protocol (1987) served as an \\nearly international precedent for trading emissions permits to address ozone depletion. \\nArticle 4.2(a) of the UNFCCC (Convention) set the foundation for early carbon markets by \\nallowing the Parties to implement emission reduction policies jointly. \\nThe Conference of the Parties or COP of the UNFCCC adopted a legal instrument in this \\nregard - the Kyoto Protocol (KP) in 1997. The KP established legally binding GHG emissions \\nreduction targets for 38 industrialised countries and Economies in Transition (EIT) – Annex-B \\nParties to the KP. Market-based mechanisms under the KP allowed Parties to meet part of \\ntheir Kyoto caps with ‘Kyoto units’ bought from other Parties. It had three mechanisms – (i) \\nClean Development Mechanism (CDM) leading to Certified Emission Reductions (CERs) \\nfrom mitigation projects in developing countries,67 (ii) Joint Implementation creating \\nEmission Reduction Units (ERUs) achieved by projects in countries with emission caps, \\nand (iii) International Emissions Trading (IET) enabled trading of Assigned Amount Units \\n(AAUs) and other Kyoto units between countries with emission caps. These mechanisms \\nlaid the foundation for the first-ever effort in the international carbon market, though \\nits initial implementation faced challenges like limited participation and complex rules. \\nHowever, after the launch of the European Union Emission Trading Scheme (EU-ETS) in \\n2005, the significance of the carbon market was realised for the first time. It was around the \\nmid-2000s that EU-ETS started functioning, and Voluntary Carbon Markets began to gain \\ntraction. The fungibility of the credits with EU-ETS helped the Kyoto Protocol to establish a \\nstronger carbon price in its first commitment period (2008-2012).\\nThe second commitment period (2013-2020) of the KP was adopted in December 2012, while \\nthe EU-ETS entered its third phase in 2013-2020. The cumulative inflow of international \\ncredits led to a large surplus in the European carbon market and undermined the carbon \\nprice incentive; for example, prices fell from €15/tCO2e in 2011 to a price range of €3 - €8/\\ntCO2e in the 2013 - 2015 period. The EU decided not to allow CERs and ERUs from KP to be \\ncompliance units within the EU-ETS and made it mandatory to exchange the Kyoto units for \\nEU-ETS emission allowances.

Given the close linkage between \\nenergy consumption and various social indicators, the Government has a priority to ensure \\naccess to sustainable and clean energy sources. Non-fossil fuel sources are critical to India’s \\nambitious NDCs and Net Zero commitment. However, phasing in of non-fossil sources has \\nits challenges – intermittency related to renewables, handling of nuclear and solar panel \\nwaste, implications of biofuel production on food security, etc. Depending on the evolving and \\nambitious NDC targets and the objective of ensuring energy security, it is amply clear that India \\nneeds to target a diversified set of energy sources. Such diversification will help minimise risks \\nassociated with energy systems while pursuing low-emission pathways in line with national \\ncommitments.  The integration of renewables, alongside exploring nuclear energy and biofuels, \\npresents a path towards achieving these objectives. This will also include a significant role for \\nthermal power, especially coal-based power plants, in providing base-load to support large-\\nscale deployment of renewables.\\n6.55.\\t In exploring the landscape for ensuring energy security, it has become evident that risks \\nare not merely obstacles but also harbingers of opportunities. While uncertainties loom, they \\npresent avenues for innovation, adaptation, and growth for India. While phasing in renewables \\nto the extent possible is imperative, in the short to medium term, the focus should also be \\non actively adopting clean coal technologies.  The Government’s initiatives for (cleaner) coal, \\nsuch as the Coal Gasification Mission, extraction of Coal Bed Methane gases, exploring Coal to \\nHydrogen, Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS), and Coal beneficiation through washeries, etc. \\nto mitigate emissions and enhance environmental sustainability needs to be promoted. With \\nthe advent of ultra super-critical technologies for coal power plants, it would be possible to \\nlower emissions and achieve higher efficiency. \\n79 Infrastructure for Resilient Island States (IRIS), UN Department of Economic and Social Affairs, Sustainable \\nDevelopment, https://sdgs.un.org/partnerships/infrastructure-resilient-island-states-iris.'),\n",

Economic growth is a pathway to achieve the end \\ngoal of development comprising economic, social, technological, and institutional progress. \\nHowever, the direction of public policy and its implementation are also instrumental in \\ntranslating growth to across-the-board human development. Home to 18 per cent of humanity1, \\nIndia’s social infrastructure must reach a diverse and expansive populace, transcending \\ncultures, languages, and geographies. Boasting a young and aspirational society, India aims \\nto seize the opportunities provided by steady and high economic growth while also ensuring \\na society characterised by better health care, education, clean water, sanitation facilities, \\naffordable housing, electricity, and the internet. A vast amount of ground has been covered to \\nensure sustainable and equitable economic growth and the journey continues with challenges, \\nold and new, as well as solutions, centralised and local. \\n7.2\\t\\nOver the last decade, the Indian concept of welfare has been significantly transformed into \\na more long-term-oriented, efficient, and empowering avatar.

In \\nlight of limited fiscal resources, the expectations of the socio-economically diverse populace \\nnecessitate a sensitive, pragmatic, and prudent welfare policy.\\n7.7\\t\\nThis required transforming the approach to a long-term-oriented, efficient, and \\nempowering one, recognising universal access to basic amenities as a starter for inclusive \\ngrowth, thus impelling an array of flagship initiatives.

Here, the \\nmeasurement of multidimensional poverty is valuable to gauge the incidence and intensity of \\npoverty as it is lived by revealing who is poor and the different disadvantages they experience.\\n7.16\\t The National Multidimensional Poverty Index (MPI) has been estimated for India by NITI \\nAayog, which is in line with the global MPI13 published by the UNDP, with a few customisations \\nfor the Indian context.14 The MPI estimated by the Niti Ayog has three equally weighted \\ndimensions: health, education, and standard of living, split across 12 weighted indicators. These \\ndeprivations are very basic and, hence, emblematic of real poverty, in addition to informing \\npolicymakers of the necessities lacking in the country.15 \\n7.17\\t While the headcount ratio measures the spread of multidimensional poverty, the \\ndeprivation score measures the intensity of multidimensional poverty (i.e., the number of \\ndeprivations experienced by a poor person). A weighted deprivation score of 0.33 is required \\nfor a household to qualify as MPI-poor. The MPI index is thus obtained as the product of \\nheadcount ratio (HCR) and intensity. \\nIndia’s Progress in MPI: 2019-21 vs. 2015-16\\n7.18\\t There has been a sharp decline in the HCR accompanied by a decrease in the intensity of \\npoverty, with the MPI nearly halving from 0.117 in 2015-16 to 0.066 in 2019-21, thereby setting \\nIndia on the path of achieving the SDG Target 1.2 (of reducing multidimensional poverty by \\nat least half) much ahead of the stipulated timeline of 2030. Resultantly, 13.5 crore Indians \\nare estimated to have escaped multidimensional poverty between 2015-16 and 2019-21. This \\ndecline is driven by declining deprivations in nutrition, years of schooling, sanitation, and \\ncooking fuel, attributable to large-scale policy attention. Region-wise, this trend is driven by \\nrural India, with the most significant improvements occurring in states like Bihar, MP, UP, \\nOdisha, and Rajasthan. Uttar Pradesh registered the most significant decline in the number of \\npoor people, with 3.43 crore people escaping multidimensional poverty. Notably, the number \\nof States with less than 10 per cent of people living in multidimensional poverty doubled from \\n7 in 2016 to 14 in 2021.\\n13\\u2002 \\x07https://hdr.undp.org/content/2023-global-multidimensional-poverty-index-mpi#/indicies/MPI\\n14\\u2002 \\x07https://www.niti.gov.in/index.php/whats-new/national-multidimentional-poverty-index-2023\\n15\\u2002 \\x07The Alkire-Foster methodology has been adopted to develop this index.

To assess the poverty levels in 2013-14 and 2022-23, projected estimates based \\non the compounded annual rate of change have been used due to data limitations for these \\nspecific periods.

Overall, the decline in \\npoverty HCR was much faster between 2015-16 and 2019-21 (10.66 per cent annual rate of \\ndecrease) than from 2005-06 to 2015-16 (7.69 per cent annual rate of decline). \\nHousehold Consumption Expenditure Survey 2022-23\\n7.21\\t The results of various initiatives in the social sector have translated into reduced \\ninequality and rising consumption spending, as evident from the results of the latest Household \\nConsumption Expenditure Survey (HCES) 2022-23 (conducted from August 2022 to July \\n2023), released on 24 February 2024.17 The results provide insights into the monetary aspect of \\nliving standards across rural and urban areas, estimated as the monthly per capita consumption \\nexpenditure (MPCE). The results broadly confirm the substantial rise in non-income aspects of \\nliving standards noted previously in the multidimensional poverty report of the NITI Aayog.\\n7.22\\t The HCES offers many reassuring findings on inclusive growth in the past decade. The \\nMPCE in 2022-23 increased in real terms by 40 per cent in rural and 33.5 per cent in urban \\nareas over 2011-12. The Gini coefficient, an indicator of inequality, has declined from 0.283 \\nto 0.266 for the rural sector and from 0.363 to 0.314 for the urban sector of the country. The \\nrural-urban divide has also declined considerably, as the difference between rural and urban \\nMPCE declined from 83.9 per cent in 2011-12 to 71.2 per cent in 2022-23. Within rural and \\nurban areas, the consumption of the lowest 5 per cent of the MPCE population grew faster than \\nthe top 5 per cent, indicating a decline in economic inequality over the last decade. Imputation \\nof free-of-cost items provided through various Government programmes leads to a further \\nprogressive rise in MPCE, with the benefit of welfare schemes as a proportion of MPCE at \\n0.8 per cent for the top 5 per cent fractile and 5.0 per cent for the bottom 5 per cent fractile \\nin rural areas (for urban areas, the corresponding figures were 0.1 per cent and 4.3 per cent \\nrespectively). Juxtaposing the MPCE numbers with the per capita gross national income (PCI) \\nreveals an inclusive trend in economic growth, where the MPCE/PCI ratio has increased for all \\nconsumption classes except the top 5 per cent in rural India and the top 10 per cent in urban \\nIndia. Notably, this progress occurred despite the once-in-a-century crisis of the COVID-19 \\npandemic.\\n16\\u2002 \\x07https://tinyurl.com/f48k757c.\\n17\\u2002 \\x07https://tinyurl.com/t8s5unut'),\n",

Globally, \\none in seven 10-19-year-olds experience a mental disorder (WHO 2021).28 According to research \\ncarried out by Gallup for UNICEF’s Changing Childhood report, a median of 19 per cent of 15 to \\n24-year-olds in 21 countries self-reported in the first half of 2021 that they often feel depressed \\nor have little interest in doing things.29 \\n7.30\\t In India, NCERT’s Mental Health and Well-being of School Students Survey30 showed an \\nincreasing prevalence of poor mental health among adolescents, exacerbated by the COVID-19 \\npandemic, with 11 per cent of students reported as feeling anxious, 14 per cent as feeling extreme \\nemotion and 43 per cent experienced mood swings. 50 per cent of students cited studies as a \\nreason for anxiety, and 31 per cent cited examination and results. \\n7.31\\t The increase in mental health issues in children and adolescents is often linked to the \\noveruse of the internet and, specifically, social media. Unrestrained and unsupervised use of the \\ninternet by children can culminate into a range of problems, from the more prevalent obsessive \\nconsumption of social media or “doom scrolling” 31 to severe ones such as cyberbullying.32 \\nJonathan Haidt, a famous American social psychologist and author, explores the impact of \\nincreased screen time and reduced free play on mental health issues among young people in his \\nbook ‘The Anxious Generation: How the great rewiring of children is causing an epidemic of \\nmental illness’. Discussing the impact of social media, overprotective parenting, and the decline \\nof unsupervised outdoor play on children’s emotional well-being, the book suggests that the \\nepidemic of mental health issues hit the world in the early 2010s with the advent of mobile \\nphones. This ‘great rewiring of childhood’ has interfered with children’s social and neurological \\ndevelopment, covering everything from sleep deprivation to attention fragmentation, addiction, \\nloneliness, social contagion, social comparison, and perfectionism.\\n27\\u2002 \\x07Dhyani A, Gaidhane A, Choudhari SG, Dave S, Choudhary S.

At an aggregate economic level, mental health disorders \\nare associated with significant productivity losses due to absenteeism, decreased productivity, \\ndisability, increased healthcare costs, etc.36 Apart from mental health impacting economic \\ndevelopment, there is also evidence of poverty affecting the risk of mental health via stressful \\nliving conditions, financial instability, and a lack of opportunities for upward mobility, which \\ncontribute to heightened psychological distress.37 Moreover, rising urbanisation and migration \\ncan disrupt social cohesion, traditional support systems, and stability, causing significant \\nmental stress (Trivedi, Sareen, and Dhyani 2008).38\\n7.34\\t Given the impact of mental health on growth, the returns on investment in the former \\nare also high.

That said, there remain certain gaps in the existing programmes \\nwhich need to be addressed to maximise their effectiveness. For instance, redoubling efforts to \\nincrease the number of psychiatrists, from 0.75 psychiatrists per lakh population in 202143 to \\nthe WHO norm of 3 per lakh population (Garg, Kumar and Chandra 2019).44\\n7.38\\t Developing comprehensive guidelines for the excellence centres’ services alongside \\nmental healthcare professionals and users would help understand their needs. Also, assessing \\nthe effectiveness of the programmes by gathering feedback from the users, professionals, and \\nstakeholders will help make necessary changes and meet the needs of a wider population. \\nNurturing peer support networks, self-help groups, and community-based rehabilitation \\nprogrammes can help destigmatisation of mental disorders and develop a sense of belonging. \\nPartnering with NGOs to scale up efforts, share knowledge, and leverage resources to enhance \\nfuture policies will also aid in identifying areas of improvement. Involving individuals with \\npersonal experience with mental health problems in decision-making, service planning, \\nand advocacy efforts can increase the person-centricity and recovery orientation of mental \\nhealthcare services (Megharajani et al. 2023).45 Sensitisation of mental health at the preschool, \\nAnganwadi level can provide precious early identification of disorders. The rise in mental \\nhealth start-ups signals a positive response from the private sector to address the care gap but \\nalso calls for standardisation of guidelines for such services.\\n7.39\\t Effective pathways for integrating mental health interventions in schools can include \\ndeveloping an age-appropriate mental health curriculum for teachers and students, encouraging \\nearly intervention and positive language in schools, promoting community-level interactions, \\nand balancing the role of technology. \\n7.40\\t However, the fundamental issue of the lack of awareness about mental health and the \\nstigma surrounding it can render any sincerely crafted programme unfeasible. Hence, there is \\na need to bring about a paradigm shift and utilise a bottom-up, whole-of-community approach \\nin addressing the topic of mental health. Breaking the stigma starts with taking cognisance of \\nthe natural human tendency to accept physical ailments and seeking treatment for the same \\nwhile being in denial about mental health issues. To an extent, the denial is an outcome of fear \\nabout social attitudes and social acceptance after one ‘comes out’ with mental health issues. \\n43\\u2002 \\x07Source: Rajya Sabha unstarred Question no. 1015 subject “Mental Health Patients and Doctors in the country”, \\nanswered on 7 December 2021.\\n44\\u2002 \\x07Garg K, Kumar CN, Chandra PS.

The share of primary and secondary care in the GHE rose from 73.2 per cent in \\nFY15 to 85.5 per cent in FY20.

This represents a 34.6 per cent to 34.1 per cent reduction relative \\nto the average NPA rates, an economically significant impact.\\nImpact on small agricultural loans: A similar reduction in NPA rates was observed in \\neligible small agricultural loans, underscoring PMJAY’s broad economic impact.\\nImplications for policy and financial markets\\nPublic health programmes and economic stability: The study illuminates the broader \\neconomic impacts of public health insurance programmes.

In 50 years, the incidence of type-II \\ndiabetes has increased from less than 2 per cent in the 1970s to more than 20 per cent.50 In \\ncognisance of the rising obesity in India, public awareness of healthy eating is being promoted \\nwith dietary guidelines issued by the National Institute of Nutrition and the Indian Council of \\nMedical Research. Secondly, public health being a state subject, state and local level governance \\nremain pivotal for the national big-ticket programmes to reach the last mile through the ‘path \\nof least resistance’. \\nEducation\\n7.48\\t ‘Quality Education’, enlisted as Goal 4 under UN SDGs (SDG4), aims to “Ensure inclusive \\nand equitable quality education and promote lifelong learning opportunities for all” by 2030. \\nThe National Education Policy (NEP), launched in 2020 and presently in its fourth year of \\nimplementation, is a policy document that not only encompasses the SDG Goals on Education \\nbut also prepares the youth of India to take on the challenges and opportunities emerging from \\na knowledge-driven economy of the 21st century.\\nSchool education\\n7.49\\t The school education system in India, with public and private schools, caters to around \\n26 crore students from various socio-economic backgrounds. The NEP 2020 seeks to provide \\nall learners in the age group of 3-18 years with access to high-quality education to create an \\neducational system that is rooted in Indian culture and has the potential to establish India as a \\nglobal knowledge superpower. \\n7.50\\t The NEP seeks to revamp the universe of school education to generate better learning \\noutcomes for all. The gravity of the emphasis on learning can be felt in the various reports \\nhighlighting the gap between class standard and learning level, which has widened since \\nCOVID.

The PM Matru Vandana \\nYojana84, entailing a cash payment of ₹ 5000 for the birth of the first child and ₹6000 for second \\nchild who is female, encourages proper rest for the new mothers by partially compensating for \\nany wage loss.

Under PMKVY, the \\nparticipation of women among those trained has increased from 42.7 per cent in FY16 to 52.3 \\nper cent in FY24. Under the Jan Shikshan Sansthan (JSS) Scheme, women constituted about \\n82 per cent of the total beneficiaries. In the long-term ecosystem, i.e., in ITIs and National \\nSkill Training Institutes (NSTIs), the participation of women has gone up from 9.8 per cent in \\nFY16 to 13.3 per cent in FY24. Under NAPS, the participation of women also increased from \\n7.7 per cent in FY17 to 20.8 per cent in FY24.

In Indian history, the \\nreservation of one-third of seats for women in Panchayats was constitutionalised in 1991, and \\nthree decades later, 46 per cent of elected representatives of Panchayats are women. According \\nto research, reservations for women in panchayats have led to greater investment in public \\ngoods closely linked to women’s concerns, such as drinking water and public roads.100 Besides, \\nfemale political representation is also associated with better child health101 and primary \\neducation outcomes.102 Along those lines, the NSVA opens new possibilities for inclusive growth \\nbesides being a beacon of gender equality. \\n7.94\\t Transformation of the feminine identity: Nari Shakti begins with the recognition of \\nwomen as individuals with an independent identity.

The female LFPR rose to \\n37 per cent in 2022-23 from 23.3 per cent in 2017-18. However, rural India has driven the \\ntrend, where nearly three-fourths of the women workers are engaged in agriculture-related \\nwork. Thus, the rise in LFPR needs to be tapped into higher value-addition sectors suitable to \\nthe needs and qualifications of the rural female workforce, and agro-processing emerges as a \\ngood contender for the same, as discussed in the chapter on Employment. The role of valuable \\nemployment in changing girls’ image from liability to breadwinner is exemplified in the story \\nof Krishnagiri district in Tamil Nadu, discussed in Box VII.8. \\nBox VII.8: Girls of Krishnagiri writing their own destinies with the ink of \\nfinancial independence108\\nA recent spate of industrial investment in the last decade has led to significant job creation for \\nfemales in Krishnagiri, a remote district in Tamil Nadu, catalysing a positive socioeconomic \\nchain reaction. The experience shows how women’s financial independence is deeply linked \\nwith their overall development, besides being a pivot for social change.\\nThe district was reeling under a high incidence of child marriage, prenatal sex selection, a \\nlow child-sex ratio (of 920, compared to the state average of 946)109, and low female literacy \\n(at 65 per cent)110. \\nThe setup of manufacturing units in electronics, mobile assembly, electric scooters, \\nfootwear, etc., has favoured large-scale employment of women, as manufacturers believed \\nfemale workers to be more productive and dexterous. This triggered a mindset shift as \\nhouseholds who considered girls a burden now view them as breadwinners, besides \\nbolstering Government welfare efforts towards female empowerment. This has resulted in a \\ndeclining incidence of child marriage and school dropout rates of girls, a rise in the average \\nage of marriage, coupled with a surge in female enrolment in polytechnic institutes. \\nThe Krishnagiri experience also spurred second-order effects from the state and corporates. \\nThe state Government-initiated policies on providing career guidance in Government \\nschools from class 9th itself, setting up industrial hostels, counselling parents, etc. The rising \\ndemand for female employees has also instilled hiring competition among companies, luring \\ntheir workforce with better pay and relaxation in education criteria by introducing on-the-\\njob training, pick-up and drop facilities, daycare facilities, etc.\\n7.96\\t To truly realise the gender dividend of workforce participation by an increasingly educated \\nand skilled female population, proper development of the care economy is essential and long \\npending, as discussed in the following chapter on Employment.\\n108\\u2002 \\x07Sourced from a media article: Madhavan, N., 27 Feb 2024, “Why women, once ignored, are being treasured in \\nKrishnagiri” Livemint, https://tinyurl.com/57pkyrra accessed on 4 June 2024.\\n109\\u2002 \\x07Census of India, 2011.\\n110\\u2002 \\x07https://krishnagiri.nic.in/about-district/district-at-a-glance/ accessed on 4 June 2024.'),\n",

The remarkable evolution of MGNREGS \\nwork from being the last resort of village-resident families to becoming more of a smart \\nchoice for household asset creation and sustainable income generation has also been noted \\npreviously.155 This indicates that other important aspects must be factored in to explain the \\nState level differences in fund usage. Some of these are discussed below.\\nSupply-side issues\\nDifference in time taken by DoRD to release funds to different States- The automated \\nprocess by DoRD ensures no significant variation in fund release times to different States, \\nindicating that this is not a cause of state-wise differences in fund usage.\\nAppropriation of MGNREGA budget between states- Differences in MGNREGS fund usage \\ncould likely stem from projected annual demands in the agreed labour budgets. Projections156 \\nfor FY25 show that states with a high rural poor population157, like UP, MP, and Bihar, will \\nhave higher annual person-days. Thus, the variance is likely due to actual fund usage based \\non the work completed.\\nDemand-side issues\\nState’s institutional capacity to tap benefits under the MGNREGS- To access MGNREGS \\nfunds, state governments must finalise labour budgets for the upcoming financial year in \\nadvance, following a bottom-up planning process.

This suggests that block-level functionaries \\nmay not register demand in real time. Consequently, formal data showing MGNREGS work \\ndemand may not reflect the true demand and current rural economic distress. This also \\nindicates that work demanded is only reported on the portal when employment is actually \\nprovided (presumably to save on the State Government’s liability towards unemployment \\nallowance). Hence work demanded on the portal is de-facto equivalent to work provided \\nand not the “real” demand.\\nIncreased leakages- Variations in MGNREGS fund usage arise from irregularities and \\nleakages observed across states. Despite lacking exhaustive documentation, news reports167, \\nsocial audits168 and anecdotal evidence suggests that funds often do not reach intended \\nbeneficiaries, making demand an unreliable distress indicator.

This evolution is a result of various factors, including economic reforms, \\ntechnological advancements, and an emphasis on skill development. The slew of structural \\nreforms promoting ease of doing business, undertaken in the last decade and ongoing, remain \\ncrucial for productive employment generation in the current decade.\\n8.4\\t According to the annual Periodic Labour Force Survey (PLFS) by the National Statistical \\nOrganisation, Ministry of Statistics and Programme Implementation (MoSPI), the all-India \\nannual unemployment rate (UR)1 (persons aged 15 years and above, as per usual status2) has \\nbeen witnessing a declining trend since the COVID-19 pandemic. This has been accompanied \\nby a rise in the labour force participation rate (LFPR)3 and worker-to-population ratio (WPR)4. \\nEven by the relatively strict standards of current weekly status (CWS)5, employment has \\nrecovered from the pandemic in urban and rural areas. \\n8.5\\t\\nThe quarterly PLFS reports for urban areas enable a more updated picture of employment. \\nThe quarterly urban unemployment rate for people aged 15 years and above declined to 6.7 per \\ncent in the quarter ending March 2024 from 6.8 per cent in the corresponding quarter of the \\nprevious year, accompanied by a rise in the WPR and LFPR (Chart VIII.2).\\n1\\u2002 \\x07UR is defined as the percentage of unemployed persons in the labour force.\\n2\\u2002 \\x07For a person to be categorised as employed as per usual status (ps+ss), he/she must have pursued an economic \\nactivity for at least 30 days during the 365 days preceding the date of the survey.\\n3\\u2002 \\x07According to the PLFS, LFPR is the percentage of working-age population engaged in work or making tangible \\nefforts to seek ‘work’ or being available for ‘work’ if it is available. ‘Work’ includes self-employment (subsistence \\nagriculture and collection of firewood, poultry farming, etc., for self-consumption), regular wage/salaried \\nemployment, and casual labour.\\n4\\u2002 \\x07WPR is defined as the percentage of employed persons in the total population.\\n5\\u2002 \\x07In the case of CWS, the activity status is determined on the basis of a reference period of the last 7 days preceding \\nthe date of the survey'),\n",

In some cases, \\nlimits have been moved from the Law to Rules to be made by states. However, the Codes \\nare yet to be fully operationalised and many states are found to be reintroducing the older \\nrestrictions under the new Laws.\\nLabour Laws need to be reviewed to re-evaluate incentives for employers, with a focus on \\nachieving better outcomes for economic growth and prosperity in the manufacturing sector. \\nImplementing more flexible labour laws could unleash substantial economic potential, \\npromote gender inclusivity, and attract industrial investment.\\n8.20\\t The states would also do well to reduce the compliance burden of the Micro, Small and \\nMedium Enterprises (MSMEs). The management bandwidth in MSMEs to grow business, \\nseek new markets, get funding, and hire labour is limited, and this limited bandwidth is spent \\ndisproportionately on compliance. Whereas the Union Government frames the Rules, the \\nimplementation or supervision is in the hands of Inspectors and Supervisors who come from \\nthe relevant departments in the states. This is where senior levels of bureaucracies at the Centre \\nand states can and should collaborate to make it easier for businesses to comply without being \\nsqueezed out of time and other resources.\\nTrend in rural wages\\n8.21\\t In FY24, rural wages rose at above-5 per cent every month, YoY.

The human resources who \\nbring about this progression must also adapt to it to be employable in the changed scenario. The \\nglobal labour market is amid a ‘disruption,’ constantly being reshaped by the fourth industrial \\nrevolution, concerted efforts by all economies to decarbonise in the wake of a looming climate \\ncrisis and other geopolitical vicissitudes. In a recent study, David Autor22 wrote that changes in \\nthe nature of work in the last few decades—primarily technological—have been more disruptive \\nand less beneficial for non-college workers.\\n8.23\\t According to the World Economic Forum’s (WEF) Future of Jobs report, 202323, in the \\nnext five years, 23 per cent of the jobs are expected to change globally. This change is likely to \\nconsist of growth in 10.2 per cent of the jobs and decline in 12.3 per cent of the jobs. Employers \\nanticipate 69 million new jobs to be created and 83 million eliminated - a net decrease of 14 \\nmillion jobs, or 2 per cent of current employment. The following are some ways in which the \\nwork environment is evolving.\\nFourth industrial revolution\\n8.24\\t Epochal changes in the economic structures manifested by three Industrial Revolutions \\n(IR), starting from the 18th century, have caused technological disruption and significant job \\ndisplacement. Each has resulted in transformations in the manner in which firms and individuals \\ninteract with the labour markets, redefining the relationship between technology and how work \\ngets done.24 Each IR caused a significant loss of livelihood for workers whose tasks were most \\nsusceptible to automation and those who could not quickly adapt to new technology. People \\nhave had to skill and reskill to maintain their place in the labour markets. \\n8.25\\t The world is in the midst of a fourth industrial revolution characterised by novel ways \\nin which technology is becoming embedded within societies through ‘cyber-physical systems,’ \\nInternet of Things (IoT), big data, nano-technology, and networks. Evolving forms of machine \\nlearning, AI, blockchains, genetic engineering, quantum computing, advanced analytics, \\nautomation, and advanced manufacturing technology are some examples of what constitutes \\nthis technological revolution. In the backdrop of this evolving revolution, the future of job \\nmarkets in India is undergoing a significant transformation, as is happening in the rest of the \\nworld.\\n8.26\\t The demand for digital roles is proliferating, hastened further by the COVID-19 pandemic \\nand its lingering impact. Technological advancements are leading to a growing demand for \\ntech-savvy professionals trained in emerging areas such as big data, AI and machine learning, \\ncybersecurity, cloud computing, etc. According to the WEF, the fastest-growing jobs in the \\nnext five years will be those of AI and machine learning specialists, sustainability specialists, \\n22\\u2002 \\x07David Autor (2019), “Work of the Past, Work of the Future”, NBER Working Paper No. 25588 http://www.nber.\\norg/papers/w25588.\\n23\\u2002 \\x07https://www.weforum.org/publications/the-future-of-jobs-report-2023/\\n24\\u2002 \\x07For instance, Didier, N.

India would not remain immune to this \\ntransformation. AI is being recognised as a general-purpose technology, like electricity and \\nthe internet, which is phenomenal in its rapid pace of innovation and ease of diffusion. As AI \\nsystems continue to get smarter and adoption increases, the future of work will be reshaped. \\nWhile AI has considerable potential for boosting productivity, it also has the potential to disrupt \\nemployment in certain sectors. Routine tasks, including customer service, will likely witness a \\nhigh degree of automation; creative sectors will see extensive usage of AI tools for image and \\nvideo creation; personalised AI tutors can reshape education and sectors like healthcare can \\nwitness accelerated drug discovery. On the impact of AI on employment, insights can be drawn \\nfrom Acemoglu and Johnson’s work, presented in Box VIII.3.\\nBox VIII.3: Ricardo’s Pivot and the Centrality of Technological Choices\\nConventional economic wisdom would suggest that technological changes generate \\nproductivity25 gains leading to higher wages and more economic opportunities in the long \\nrun. However, according to Acemoglu and Johnson (2024)26, “… taking such a long view \\nignores the struggles of workers to secure their fair share of prosperity made possible \\nby the new machinery.” The authors take a cue from Industrial Revolution in Britain to \\nunderstand the relationship between AI-induced rise in productivity and employment in the \\npresent. Specifically, the authors take the examples of automation of cotton spinning through \\nthe introduction of the spinning jenny in the late 18th century, automation of weaving by the \\npower loom in the 19th century, and the advent of the railways and heavy industries in the \\nsecond half of 19th century. \\n \\nSpinning Jenny27\\nPower loom in a factory28\\n25\\u2002 \\x07Productivity refers to how much output can be produced with a given set of inputs.

The decline in real wages of weavers after the arrival of \\npower loom is said to be behind Ricardo’s change in opinion from “machinery did not lessen \\nthe demand for labour” in 1819 to “If machinery could do all the work that labour now \\ndoes, there would be no demand for labour” in 1821. Likewise, the coming of the Liverpool \\nand Manchester railways in 1830 spurred new jobs in modern manufacturing, including \\ndesign, repair, maintenance, and clerical tasks.\\nThe authors highlight the inadequacy of economic factors to explain the impact of automation \\non wages and emphasise on the forces of political economy, i.e., the balance of power between \\nlabour and capital. Here, the interpretation of E.P. Thompson, an English historian, seems \\nmore suitable to them in explaining the impact of power loom on weavers. According to \\nThompson, the movement of workers to factories led to their loss of autonomy, and, in the \\nabsence of any policy support or bargaining power, culminated in the deterioration of wages \\nand worker conditions.\\nIn simple words, it is how we use the technology- whether we use it for automation, \\nsurveillance and control or we use it for informed decision making, problem-solving and \\naugmentation29, that decides whether AI will facilitate the path of job creation or will be a \\nhindrance to it. During Ricardo’s time, this choice was made by the factory owners, employers \\nand industrialists while labourers underwent harsh working conditions, surveillance and \\ncontrol. Times have changed now, workers are certainly more independent, and hold power \\nthrough strict labour laws and trade unions. Several reports today mention that AI will not \\ndestroy jobs rather transform them. Studies emphasise the need for humans to guide this AI \\ntransition.30 31 \\nThe paper concludes that automation may be good or bad, depending on how we deploy it, \\nand the direction of the technology being implemented. New technology can hurt labour \\ninterests by reducing the marginal productivity of labour32 while overall productivity may \\nrise, thereby leading to substitution of labour by machines, as in the case of the handloom \\nweavers. At the same time, automation can benefit labour in two ways. Firstly, if it significantly \\nincreases the marginal productivity of labour in the right sectors thereby increasing labour \\ndemand in non-automated tasks or in industries producing complementary products, as \\nin the case of jennies. Secondly, when automation is accompanied by creation of new tasks \\nand increase in marginal productivity of labour in new activities like in the railways example \\n(Acemoglu and Johnson 2023). That said, political economy remains decisive in ensuring \\nshared prosperity from technology. This is termed as the ‘centrality of technological \\nchoices’.\\n29\\u2002 \\x07https://www.project-syndicate.org/commentary/ai-automation-threatens-workers-lessons-from-industrial-\\nrevolution-and-david-ricardo-by-daron-acemoglu-and-simon-johnson-2024-04 \\n30\\u2002 \\x07https://www.ilo.org/resource/news/generative-ai-likely-augment-rather-destroy-jobs\\n31\\u2002 \\x07https://hbr.org/2021/11/automation-doesnt-just-create-or-destroy-jobs-it-transforms-them \\n32\\u2002 \\x07The marginal product(ivity) of labour is defined as the amount that output would be increased if one more unit \\nof labour were employed, while everything else remains the same.'),\n",

At the same time, the rest could benefit from enhanced \\nproductivity through AI integration. It finds that employment highly exposed to AI is 26 per \\ncent for India, divided into 14 per cent for occupations with high complementarity and 12 per \\ncent for those with low complementarity.36 37\\n8.29\\t India, with its vast demographic dividend and a very young population, is uniquely situated \\nas AI poses both risk and opportunity. According to Capital Economics (2024), the current \\ndiffusion and adaptation of AI in India remains low compared to US, Europe, and the developed \\nAsian economies. Manufacturing sector is less exposed to AI as industrial robots are neither as \\nnimble nor as cost-effective as human labour. In inventory and supply chain management, \\nAI applications could rather be complementary to labour. Nevertheless, at particular risk is \\nthe BPO sector, where GenAI is revolutionising the performance of routine cognitive tasks \\nthrough chatbots, and employment in the sector is estimated to decline considerably in the \\nnext ten years. In the following decade, however, gradual diffusion of AI is expected to augment \\nproductivity. Uses of AI to identify health risks out of digitalised health data, predict weather, \\nand complementing teachers in grading tests and translating texts are some of the development \\ngaps that AI can plug.38\\n8.30\\t Widespread adoption of AI across the services sector can significantly reshape and even \\nreplace jobs. Based on job postings data from India’s largest job website, Copestake, A. et. al. \\n(2023) interpret a near-exponential increase in the demand for AI-related skills since 2016. \\nThey find that the demand for AI skills by businesses has a negative impact on the need for non-\\nAI roles and on the top percentile of wages, due to the displacement of high-skilled, managerial \\npositions and non-routine, intellectual tasks.39\\n8.31\\t Given the affinity of India’s population to work with technology, as seen with the digital \\npublic infrastructure, proactive interventions by the Government and industry can position \\nIndia as a key player in the AI age.

This strategy marks a \\nsignificant move of the US Government to address the challenges that cannot be resolved by the \\nsectors alone.\\n8.34\\t A policy brief by Research and Information System for Developing Countries (RIS) \\nsuggested that there is a need for an Inter-Agency Coordination Authority for AI which would \\nact as a central institution guiding the research, decision-making, policy planning on AI and \\njob creation.43 The brief also suggested that AI will create more jobs but may have a negative \\nshort-term impact, and to counter this impact there is a need to invest in capacity building, \\nupskilling, training, and forming policies to ensure that low-skilled workers do not suffer from \\nany potential job losses.\\n8.35\\t AI has made a significant growth in the agri-tech, industry & automotive, healthcare, \\nBFSI and retail sectors in India.

It encompasses freelancers, online platform workers, self-employed, on-call \\nworkers, and creative tech talent. In India, the rise of the gig economy is driven by the \\nemergence of tech-enabled platforms, an increase in access to the internet backed by the \\ndevelopment of digital public infrastructure, the demand for flexible work arrangements, \\nand the focus on skills. According to NITI Aayog’s indicative estimates based on national \\nlabour force survey data, in 2020–21, 77 lakh (7.7 million) workers were engaged in the gig \\neconomy. They constituted 2.6 per cent of the non-agricultural workforce or 1.5 per cent of \\nthe total workforce in India.47\\n8.38\\t Research studies have shown that participation in the gig economy is higher in developing \\ncountries (between five and 12 per cent) compared to developed economies (between one \\nand four per cent), and most of these jobs are in lower-income job types, such as deliveries, \\nridesharing, microtasks, care and wellness (BCG 2021).48 The continuing high demand for \\nsuch services and job flexibility is boosting entry-level job creation in tier-2 and tier-3 cities, \\nincluding part-time work for students entering the job market or as a shock absorber in case \\nof temporary unemployment, with a high probability of workers moving to better-paying jobs \\nafter the platform experience (NCAER 2023).49 \\n8.39\\t The gig workforce is expected to expand to 2.35 crore (23.5 million) by 2029–30. Gig \\nworkers are expected to form 6.7 per cent per cent of the non-agricultural workforce or 4.1 \\nper cent of the total livelihood in India by 2029–30.50 While the gig economy may open up \\nemployment opportunities for various sections of workers, including youth, persons with \\ndisabilities, and women, a significant issue in the Indian context and globally has been the \\ncreation of effective social security initiatives for gig and platform workers.

This trend is leading to businesses \\nwitnessing a strong job-creation effect driven by investments that facilitate the green transition \\nof businesses and the application of ESG standards. \\n8.42\\t For instance, India’s green transition is and is more likely to significantly impact job \\nopportunities in the renewable energy sector. Tyagi et al (2021)52 observes that, by 2030, \\nclean energy initiatives can potentially create about 3.4 million jobs (short and long-term) by \\ninstalling 238 GW of solar and 101 GW of new wind capacity to achieve the 500 GW non-fossil \\nelectricity generation capacity. These jobs represent those created in the wind and on-grid solar \\nenergy sectors. About one million can be employed to take up these green jobs.53 \\n8.43\\t Climate change also affects worker well-being, as highlighted in a recent ILO report54, \\ncreating a ‘cocktail’ of health hazards for 70 per cent of the world’s workforce. Workers, \\nespecially those in manual jobs, thus need suitably designed policy support and private \\ninsurance products to protect their health and incomes from the vagaries of heatwaves, floods, \\ncyclones, etc. Here, an innovative pilot programme by Self Employed Women’s Association \\n(SEWA) is noteworthy. Launched in 2023, a heat-linked parametric insurance covering 22,000 \\nunorganised workers entails partial wage payment when temperature breaches 43.60 C with \\nthe premium borne partially by the worker and rest through charity. By helping the workers \\nto cover food and medication requirement, the payout provides a shield against the scorching \\nheat. Ultimately, SEWA plans to sign up 29 lakh members which would allow the premiums to \\nbe fully funded by the workers themselves.55\\n8.44\\t To sum up, as the country navigates the complexities of the future job market alongside \\nthe global trends, as discussed above, acceptance and adapting to change and encouraging \\ninnovation will be the key to harnessing the opportunities and dealing with the challenges \\npresented before us.

In contrast, 30 per cent of food in \\nChina is processed as against 60-80 per cent in Western countries (Liu et al. 2007).65 \\n8.50\\t Rising demand for diverse and local food products: A better connection of farmers with \\nfood processing units could bring a more extensive and diverse pool of agricultural products \\nto the market, the demand for which has been rising with affluence and diet-consciousness \\nin India and abroad. As per a report by InvestIndia66, the Indian food processing market is \\nestimated to reach USD535 billion by 2025, growing at a CAGR of 15.2 per cent.

Care work falls into two categories: compensated and unpaid/underpaid. Unpaid \\nor underpaid work related to caregiving and providing social support is often performed within \\nhouseholds by females and usually consists of childcare, eldercare, domestic work, etc. Paid \\ncare work involves labour performed by nurses, caregivers, etc., for remuneration. \\nIncreasing need for a well-developed care economy\\nDemographic transition – need to prepare for future care requirements of an \\nageing population\\n8.57\\t India’s care needs are slated to expand significantly in the next 25 years, as an ageing \\npopulation follows the ongoing demographic transition while the population of children stays \\nrelatively sizeable. According to the United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA)72as of 2022, \\none-fourth of India’s population is aged 0-14 years (i.e., 36 crore persons), while one-tenth is \\nabove 60 years (i.e., 14.7 crore persons). By 2050, the share of children is estimated to decline \\nto 18 per cent (i.e., 30 crore persons), while the proportion of elderly persons would rise to 20.8 \\nper cent (i.e., 34.7 crore persons). Thus, compared to 50.7 crore persons in 2022, the country \\nwould need to care for 64.7 crore persons in 2050. The additional requirements for care would \\nbe further upscaled as more women participate in paid work, the rising prevalence of nuclear \\nfamilies73, etc.\\nEqual opportunity for females – decoupling gender and unpaid care work\\n8.58\\t Developing an appropriate care economy is crucial when viewed through the lens of \\nfairness and efficiency of increasing the FLFPR by affording equal opportunity to participate \\nin paid work. This is especially important given the predominant burden of unpaid care work, \\nincluding domestic work, childcare, and elderly care, falling on women, who are then too “time-\\npoor” to participate fully in employment opportunities. This is a global phenomenon, which \\nholds for India as well. The disproportionate burden of care on women is consequential to the \\nlow FLFPR across the world, including India.74 According to Sinha et al. (2024), an additional \\nhour of caregiving per day reduces women’s labour market participation by 20 percentage \\npoints, with no effect on men.75\\n72\\u2002 \\x07International Institute for Population Sciences and United Nations Population Fund, “India Ageing Report \\n2023”, \\nhttps://india.unfpa.org/sites/default/files/pub-pdf/20230926_india_ageing_report_2023_web_\\nversion_.pdf \\n73\\u2002 \\x07The share of nuclear families has been estimated to have increased from 37 per cent of total households in 2008 \\nto 50 per cent of total households in 2022, according to data from a consumer survey company Kantar.\\n74\\u2002 \\x07United Nations Economic and Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific (UNESCAP).

Even women \\nin paid employment spend nearly 6X time on unpaid care work compared to men in paid \\nemployment, culminating in the ‘double burden’ of performing both paid work and unpaid care \\nresponsibilities. This care burden-induced professional inequality is in contrast with the rising \\nequality of opportunity in education, with the closing of the gender gap in higher education \\nenrolment in India.\\n8.60\\t Specifically, the impact of childbearing and childcare is found to have a significant cost \\non women’s careers, termed the ‘motherhood penalty’, depicted as a drop in FLFPR around \\nchildbearing years and a loss of income. Regarding the quality of employment, the motherhood \\npenalty manifests in women tending to be concentrated in farming and informal jobs, as those \\nworkspaces are compatible with their personal care responsibilities (Palriwala and Neetha \\n(2012)).76 Even though the time spent on unpaid care work per day is only 9 minutes higher for \\nrural women vis-à-vis urban women, higher rural FLFPR could be explained by the flexibility, \\nin terms of timing and proximity of employment, which allows child supervision, that rural jobs \\ntypically provide (Gautham 2022).77\\nEconomic potential – generating value by making the best use of human capital \\n8.61\\t This unpaid/invisible domestic work performed by women, which is usually neglected \\nwhile calculating the labour force and the GDP, has been variously estimated as highly valuable \\nyet invisible.

According to ILO \\n(2018), the care sector is one of the fastest-growing sectors globally, and investments in the \\ncare services sector are estimated to generate 475 million jobs globally by 2030. In the case of \\nIndia, direct public investment equivalent to 2 per cent of GDP has the potential to generate 11 \\nmillion jobs, nearly 70 per cent of which will go to women.79 \\nMultidimensional impact of creches - Empirical evidence \\n8.63\\t A wide range of research has emphasised the impact of affordable and reliable childcare on \\nfreeing women’s time for paid employment, enhancing mental health and improving children’s \\nlearning and nutrition.

Such \\nlearning opportunities act as the bridge that aids people to cross over from informal work to \\nformal employment or to smooth the move from academics to the workplace. They are an \\nessential component of the skilling ecosystem which is the backbone for both employment \\nand entrepreneurship. \\nThe Apprentices Act, 1961 (Act) provides for establishments in all sectors of manufacturing \\nand services with more than 30 employees to mandatorily undertake apprenticeships in a \\nrange from 2.5 - 15 per cent of their workforce101.

The Rules provide \\n6 – 36-month duration apprenticeship programmes with a minimum stipend of ₹5000 - \\n9000 per month to apprentices and the rate is linked to the educational qualification of the \\ncandidate. The Act and the Rules have been amended in 2014, 2015, and 2019, to make it \\nmore liberal for establishments and apprentices. \\nThe National Apprenticeship Promotion Scheme102 (NAPS) was introduced in August 2016 \\nto meet the demand for a skilled workforce, promote the industrial economy, and provide \\nexperiential learning opportunities to the youth.

Empirical evidence shows \\nthat, in a smooth functioning apprenticeship ecosystem, a large share of firms (30 per cent \\nin Germany and 60 per cent in Switzerland) recoup their investment of hiring an apprentice \\nby the end of the training period, while being guided by their cost-benefit analysis in \\nhiring apprentices (Muehlemann and Wolter 2014).105 Firms also retain the most eligible \\napprentices while the others seek employment elsewhere. \\nThere exist significant challenges in the Indian apprenticeship ecosystem, such as lack of \\ncoordination between education institutions and industry, inadequate infrastructure, gaps \\nin the regulatory framework (Ravichandran 2023).106 Besides, the negative perception of \\nvocational training as being inferior to academic education is one of the biggest challenges \\n(Gupta and Dharap 2022).107 \\nThe outcomes from the apprenticeship schemes signal scope for improvement. The NAPS 2.0 \\nset an ambitious target of enrol 46 lakh apprentices in the four years from 2022-23 to 2025-\\n26, whereas the enrolments from 2016-17 to 2021-22 were 15.96 lakh. The technological \\nintervention of having a unified portal and moving payments to the direct benefit transfer \\nsystem may have helped increase enrolments from 2.90 lakh in FY 21 to 5.80 lakh in FY 22 \\nbut few systemic weaknesses need to be addressed if the target is to be achieved. Of more \\nconcern is that less than 50 percent of apprentices engaged have completed training. There \\nis a lack of information on the final outcome of gainful employment for the trainees. Only \\naround 47,000 of the 2.21 lakh establishments have active programmes, indicating a need to \\ngenerate employers’ interest in apprenticeship.108\\nThe apprenticeship framework thus needs to be re-calibrated to provide flexibility and \\nnegotiability in work hours, compensation, and disengagement, emulating the Swiss and \\nGerman models of apprenticeships where students work as apprentices on weekends on \\nmutually agreeable terms. The regulatory framework needs to be mindful of the cost-\\nbenefit ratio of hiring apprentices for local firms. As it stands, apprentices’ productivity and \\nworking hour may vary and flexibility in the contract terms could enable mutually beneficial \\narrangements rather than closing doors for any engagement. There is a need to minimise the \\nrole of Government agencies in order to address the delays in the programme and ease the \\ncompliance requirements of establishments.

These trends and the \\ncountry’s commitment to technological advancement and infrastructure development have \\npositioned India as a dynamic and resilient player in the global job market. The Government \\nis striving to nurture the foundations of employment creation by creating an ecosystem of \\nease of doing business, lower logistical costs, meaningful skill development, and easy credit \\nfor entrepreneurship. This approach may take some time to bear results, but with steadfast \\nefforts and good intentions, it will facilitate sustainable employment creation for everyone in \\nthe country. \\n8.84\\t Nevertheless, there remain long-existing challenges of formalising a burgeoning workforce, \\nfacilitating job creation in sectors which can absorb workers shifting from agriculture, and \\nensuring social security benefits for those in regular wage/salaried employment (as per PLFS \\n2022-23, 53 per cent of regular wage/salaried employees are not eligible for any social security \\nbenefit). The state governments can grease the wheels of hiring by businesses by easing the \\ncompliance burden and reforming laws on land, etc., to suit the priorities of development.\\n8.85\\t The agro-processing sector lies at the overlap of India’s requirements of productive, \\nintermediate, and large-scale job creation for rural youth and women, with rich dividends to \\nreap from the convergence of schemes and a mission-mode unwavering focus at a national \\nscale. The Sahyadri farmer producer company is a shining example from a long list of success \\nstories.\\n8.86\\t Concurrently, the employment landscape is fast changing worldwide, and India, aspiring \\nto be a developed nation by 2047, must partake in the massive reshaping of jobs that AI has and \\nis likely to further spin off. The impact of automation on workers being complex and uncertain, \\nthe direction of technological change remains susceptible to forces of political economy. India \\nthus needs to invest in research and steer the AI bandwagon towards shared prosperity. At the \\nsame time, something as basic and age-old as unpaid care work needs our attention too.

India’s corporate sector has never had it so \\ngood as now, with profitability at a 15-year high in FY24. Profits had quadrupled between FY20 \\nand FY23.

As important, capital and labour shares of income have to be fair. In \\ntheir fascination for AI and fear of erosion of competitiveness, businesses have to bear in mind \\ntheir responsibility for employment generation and the consequent impact on social stability. \\n8.88\\t With respect to skilling too, it is a priority that lends itself to market-based solutions. \\nThere is a skill-seeker who benefits economically from better skills; there is a skill-provider \\nwho earns fee income for imparting it and there are employers who benefit from a skilled \\nand productive workforce. Therefore, it is a challenge that the market can solve and to the \\nextent that regulatory hurdles (including, for example, land availability for setting up skilling \\nfacilities) stand in the way of the market solving this problem, that is the responsibility of the \\nGovernments – union and states – to remove them. \\n8.89\\t This chapter has provided a broad estimate of the number of jobs that the economy has \\nto generate. Of course, not all of them will seek jobs. Some of them will be self-employed and \\nsome of them will be employers too. More than jobs, economic growth is about generating \\nlivelihoods. Technological change, geopolitical churn and climate change combine to make this \\na formidable challenge. Rising to it requires us – Governments at all levels and the private \\nsector – to strive together.\\n********'),\n",

This process, among other things, establishes a link between present and future \\nproduction and consumption cycles, thereby facilitating the inter-temporal smoothing of \\nprices.

India had around \\n300 commodity exchanges during the 1940s. Until 1952, trading in these exchanges was not \\nregulated by a standard policy or a market regulator. After independence, the GoI formulated \\nthe Forward Contracts (Regulation) Act of 1952 and set up the Forward Market Commission \\n(FMC) in 1953 as the regulator. In 1966, a comprehensive ban on futures trading was imposed \\nto control price volatility. At different times, the GoI appointed different committees to look \\ninto the feasibility of reintroducing commodity derivatives trading. \\nAgriculture futures trade in India got a major revival in 2003 with the setting up of \\nnational exchanges such as the National Commodity and Derivative Exchange (NCDEX), \\nMulti Commodity Exchange (MCX), and National Multi Commodity Exchange (NMCE). A \\nsignificant development in the Indian commodity regulatory landscape happened in 2015 \\nwhen the GoI repealed the Forward Contracts Regulation Act 1952 (FCRA), and Commodity \\nderivatives markets were brought under the Securities Contracts (Regulations) Act (SCRA), \\n1956 with the Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) taking over from the Forward \\nMarket Commission as the commodity market regulator in September 2015. In parallel, \\ne-NAM were introduced by the GoI in 2016 to provide farmers with an electronic online \\nmarketplace for agricultural produce. Electronic spot markets for commodities are crucial \\nin integrating localised physical markets, establishing a direct link between the buyer and \\nseller and providing a transparent price discovery mechanism.\\nCurrent state of play: The commodity futures market can effectively contribute to \\nprice discovery only when many consumers, producers, traders, and aggregators use these \\nmarkets to hedge their risk. The interplay of these participants, speculators, and arbitrageurs \\nprovides liquidity and helps price discovery for longer periods. However, given that most \\nIndian farmers are marginal with fragmented land holdings, they are often left without \\nthe necessary wherewithal to engage/participate in these markets effectively, leading to \\nreduced depth in the Indian commodity futures market. Further, it is also observed that \\nthe requirement of standardised exchange contracts with specified quality parameters and \\ndelivery requirements has also impeded the majority of Indian farmers from effectively \\nengaging in the commodity futures market since the Indian farmers produce different \\nvarieties of commodities in widely varying qualities due to varied geographical, weather, \\nand soil conditions. Additionally, periodic bans imposed by GoI on futures trading on agri-\\ncommodities as one of the measures to counter food inflation have also had implications on \\nthe traded value and price volume in Indian commodity and derivative exchanges.\\nThe way forward: Studies point out that the Indian commodity market can be strengthened \\nthrough a sequenced diversification of agri-future portfolio. As is highlighted in the 2008 \\nAbhijit Sen Committee Report, “combining prudence with the benefit of the doubt, the best \\ncourse of action would be to identify those commodities where there is the possibility of \\nfutures trading affecting expectations that may influence inflation in essential commodities \\nand insulate these from futures.” Sensitive commodities (e.g., common rice, wheat, most \\npulses, etc.) may be kept outside the ambit of the futures market until the markets are \\ndeveloped and the regulator has a higher degree of comfort in diversifying the portfolio. The \\nagriculture futures market may focus on less sensitive commodities like oilseed complex \\n(oilseeds, meals, and oils), feed (maise), cotton, basmati rice, spices, etc. \\nAs part of recent policy initiatives to broaden the commodity derivatives market, the'),\n",

Skilling and hand-holding the FPOs through financial literacy \\ninitiatives can go a long way in encouraging the farmers to benefit from the Agri-derivative \\nmarkets. As the depth and liquidity in the agri-derivative market increases in the long -run, \\nbanning futures trading may no longer be required to stabilise prices unless there is data-\\nbacked evidence of futures trading driving up price volatility.

More than ₹3.24 lakh Crore \\nhas been released to more than 11 crore farmers as of 10 July 2024. \\n9.22\\t To provide social security to the most vulnerable farmer families, the Government \\nimplements Pradhan Mantri Kisan Maandhan Yojna (PMKMY). The scheme offers a monthly \\npension of ₹3,000 to the enrolled farmers on the attainment of 60 years of age, based on a \\nnominal premium between ₹55 to ₹200 per month paid by the applicant (in the age group 18 \\nto 40 years) subject to exclusion criteria. As per the Ministry of Agriculture, as of 07 July 2024, \\n23.41 lakh farmers have enrolled under the scheme. \\nFarm Mechanisation- Powering agriculture\\n9.23\\t Agricultural mechanisation covering simple hand tools to more complex machinery has \\nbecome essential to modern agriculture and contributes towards productivity. Considering that \\nmost farmers in India are small and marginal, providing machinery through custom hiring \\ncan enhance the adoption of farm mechanisation among these farmers and in regions where \\nmechanisation levels are currently low. The Sub Mission on Agricultural Mechanization (SMAM) \\nprovides assistance to the State Government for training and demonstration of agricultural \\nmachinery, setting up of Custom Hiring Centres (CHC) and assists farmers in procuring various \\nfarm machinery and equipment. The total funds allocated under SMAM from 2014-15 to 2023-\\n24 was ₹7.26 Thousand Crore. In 2023-24, the allocation was ₹859.45 Crore. Further, Farm \\nMachinery Banks promote access to high-tech machinery for small and marginal farm holdings \\nand farm holdings under challenging areas with low levels of mechanisation. During the period \\n2014-15 to 2023-24, 25527 CHC were established under the scheme, and 607 CHC were set up \\nin 2023-24. \\nMaking Agriculture Sustainable\\n9.24\\t A growing challenge in agriculture pertains to sustainability issues like overexploitation, \\ndegradation of natural resources, and addressing the impact of climate change. The agricultural \\nmethods and inputs used have also had significant implications for sustainable agriculture. \\nFor example, increased use of fertiliser and chemicals, overexploitation, and unsustainable \\nuse of water resources have affected soil health and fertility.  Variability in weather conditions \\nand the relative predominance of rainfed agriculture also impact production and productivity. \\nSustainability in agriculture is highly relevant to securing the long-term productivity of land \\nholdings, ensuring sufficient farm-based incomes and food security. With 11 of the 17 Sustainable \\nDevelopment Goals (SDGs) directly linked to agriculture, securing improvements in crop yields \\nand ensuring income stability is vital for the country as it strives to achieve the Agenda 2030 \\ngoals. \\n9.25\\t  The climate change impact assessment carried out by the government underscores the \\nneed for adaptation in the sector. In the absence of the adoption of adaptation measures, \\nrainfed rice yields in India are projected to drop by 20 per cent in 2050 and 47 per cent in 2080 \\nscenarios, while irrigated rice yields are projected to reduce by 3.5 per cent in 2050 and 5 per'),\n",

Irrigation area coverage increased \\nfrom 49.3 per cent of gross cropped area (GCA) in 2015-16 to 55 in 2020-21. Similarly, irrigation \\nintensity (ratio of gross irrigated area to net irrigated area) recorded a rise of 10.3 percentage \\npoints, from 144.2 per cent in 2015-16 to around 154.5 per cent in 2021-22, while cropping \\nintensity increased by 12.8 percentage points during this period35. A Micro Irrigation Fund \\n(MIF) of an initial corpus ₹5 thousand Crore has also been created with NABARD to facilitate \\nthe States in mobilising the resources for expanding coverage of micro irrigation.

This plant \\nincludes 23,000 mirrors that direct sunlight to a 127-meter-high tower weighing 234 tons. \\nThe generated heat serves three purposes: maintaining optimal temperatures in 20 hectares\\nof greenhouses, generating electricity via a turbine to power farm systems, and desalinating \\nseawater drawn from the nearby Spencer Gulf. The farm produces one million liters of \\nfresh water daily by desalinating seawater from 3 kilometers away. It grows 7,000 tonnes \\nof tomatoes annually, which accounts for 15 per cent of Australia’s total crop, on arid land. \\nIn addition, 180,000 tomatoes are grown hydroponically in stacks without soil, saving 2 \\nmillion liters of diesel and reducing CO2 emissions by 15,000 tons compared to traditional \\nfarming methods.\\nThis method entails growing plants in nutrient-rich water solutions customized to their \\nspecific requirements. Vertical hydroponic systems can be employed in urban areas, reducing \\nthe environmental impact of transportation and offering locally sourced fresh produce.\\nTemporary Flood Water Storage in Agricultural Areas in the Middle Tisza River \\nBasin\\nIn the Middle Tisza River Basin, temporary floodwater storage in agricultural areas is being \\nused to reduce flood risks and provide extra irrigation. By storing excess floodwater in \\nspecific agricultural fields, the region can better control water levels, decreasing the risk of \\nflooding downstream. This method not only safeguards infrastructure but also improves \\nsoil fertility by depositing nutrients from the floodwaters, leading to increased agricultural \\nproductivity.\\nThese interventions demonstrate innovative water management and agricultural productivity \\napproaches, addressing specific regional challenges with tailored solutions.\\n9.27\\t Another area of intervention is focused on reducing the use of chemical fertilisers in \\nIndian agriculture. Even while the per-hectare usage of agricultural chemicals in India remains \\nsignificantly lower than in most developed countries, its use of chemical fertilisers has increased \\nover the years38.

While the \\ncomposition is important, so is the quantity of application. With the view to building knowledge \\nand capacity among farmers, demonstrations to administer precise fertiliser application were \\ncarried out with more than 1.79 Lakh drones across several states.  \\n9.28\\t The PM Programme for Restoration, Awareness Generation, Nourishment, and \\nAmelioration of Mother Earth (PM-PRANAM ) initiative incentivises states to reduce chemical \\nfertiliser use.

The growing \\nsignificance of allied sectors such as animal husbandry, dairying, and fisheries in enhancing \\nfarmers’ income suggests that greater emphasis should be placed on tapping into the potential \\nof these activities to boost farmers’ incomes. Smallholder farmers’ incomes cannot be increased \\nby producing rice, wheat, or even millets, pulses and oilseeds. They need to move to high-value \\nagriculture – fruits and vegetables, fisheries, poultry, dairy and buffalo meat. Once the incomes \\nof smallholders increase, they will demand manufactured goods, spurring a manufacturing \\nrevolution. That is what happened in China between 1978 and 1984 when the real incomes of \\nfarmers doubled in just 6 years.

Industrial GVA at constant prices in FY24 was 25 per cent higher than the \\npre-Covid FY20 levels, affirming broad-based recovery and consolidation. This \\nwas supported by greater credit offtake, a thrust on capital formation to shore up \\ninfrastructure-oriented sectors, and a supportive policy framework. \\nIn the last decade, there were considerable changes in the sectoral composition of India’s \\nmanufacturing landscape. Some consumer-oriented industries like automobiles, wood \\nproducts, furniture and pharmaceuticals have made large gains in output share and \\nproduction-oriented sectors like machinery, chemicals, non-metallic minerals, and \\nrubber and plastic products have also had share gains, balancing the growth dynamics. \\nAt a same time, sectors like petroleum products, textiles, beverage and tobacco have \\nwitnessed gradual decline in their output share.\\nGoing forward, invigorating ongoing efforts to impart greater efficiencies, skills, and \\ndynamics to labour-intensive segments like textiles, food processing, and MSMEs \\nwould lend greater balance to industrial expansion. Incentivising R&D investment, \\ngreater formalisation of smaller manufacturers, alleviating their supply chain \\nbottlenecks, facilitating market access and improving access to finance will also \\nfoster industrialisation. Further reduction in the compliance burden for MSMEs will \\nconsiderably improve their growth prospects.\\nDomestic demand conditions on account of consumption and investment are strong \\nand conducive to smooth industrial output expansion in the near term. A forward-\\nlooking survey of the Reserve Bank of India on business expectations and industrial \\noutlook presents a positive outlook. However, headwinds persist in terms of uncertain \\nglobal demand conditions and prices of key inputs for which India is import-dependent. \\nINTRODUCTION\\n10.1\\t\\nEconomic growth of 8.2 per cent in FY24 was supported by an industrial growth of \\n9.5 per cent.1 Among the four sub-sectors of industry, manufacturing and construction \\nachieved close to double-digit growth, while mining & quarrying and electricity & water supply \\nalso recorded strong positive growth in FY24.

As the name suggests, ‘innovator’ firms carry out extensive research to bring \\nnew medicines or treatments for diseases to the world. Considering the extent of time and \\nresources as also the risk involved in the process, the prices of such medicines are usually very \\nhigh. Such firms thrive on monopolies created through intellectual property rights owned by \\nthem for these new medicines. In recent years, big innovator pharma companies have made \\na strategic move to invest in smaller, more agile research-oriented firms. Between 2021 and \\n2023, the investment amounted to USD 54 billion in small bio-tech firms.16\\nIndia’s strength in the pharmaceutical sector lies in being a cost effective and efficient \\nproducer of existing off patented drugs- also called the generic industry. Even so research \\nand development is key to producing the same medicines once they get off patent at a \\nfraction of the cost of the original drug. They thrive on competition. The world needs both \\nthe innovators and those that can provide drugs at a reasonable price, with the latter playing \\na vital role in enhancing social benefits. Hence, the strength of the industry lies in having a \\ndiverse combination of innovators and generic producers. \\nAs we move towards realising the vision of Viksit Bharat, it is vital to promote innovation. \\nThe R&D expenditure in the drugs and pharmaceutical sector in India averaged around 5 \\nper cent of the sales turnover in FY20 and FY2117.

Further, research shows that reimagining the level of regulations on the usage of \\nfactory space, like those relating to setbacks, will likely augment the manufacturing capacity, \\nespecially of the micro and small firms (Box X.9).\\nBox X.9: Reimagining building regulations to augment manufacturing capacity\\nExisting industrial building regulations limit factory land usage, reducing land utility and \\nresulting in unquantified costs. The report titled State of Regulation: Building Standards \\nReforms for Jobs and Growth22 illustrates how land remains unutilised while complying \\nwith the four building regulations relating to ground coverage, setbacks, parking and floor \\narea ratio.  \\n\\t1.\\t \\x07Land lost due to Ground Coverage: The report shows that under the ground \\ncoverage regulations on factory plots, intended to control density and promote \\ngroundwater recharge, a factory building can cover no more than 40–60 per cent \\nof the plot, depending on the State in which the factory conducts its operations. In \\ncomparison, in Hong Kong, a factory will not lose any proportion of the plot; in the \\nPhilippines, only 30 per cent of the plot.\\n\\t2.\\t \\x07Land lost due to Setbacks: State-level regulations limit the horizontal building \\nexpansion to minimise fire risk and ensure ventilation and light. The aforementioned \\nreport shows that regulations, however, do not account for modernisation in technology \\nand manufacturing processes. For example, the use of fire-resistant materials and \\nautomatic fire-fighting equipment can effectively reduce hazards without locking up \\nproductive land. Moreover, natural light and ventilation may be counterproductive \\nin certain industries like chemicals, pharmaceuticals, and electronics. Setbacks are \\nparticularly challenging for micro and small factories in certain States. The factories \\nend up losing even 60–90 per cent of their land in certain States just to comply with \\nthese regulations. A mega factory in an Indian State loses ~2X more land to setbacks \\nthan one in the Philippines and ~5X more than the one in Singapore.\\n\\t3.\\t \\x07Land lost due to Parking Regulations: State governments enforce regulations \\nmandating off-street parking to ease street congestion. However, research suggests \\nthat these mandates may actually contribute to more congestion.

However, such regulations may inadvertently contribute to urban sprawl, \\nthereby exacerbating road congestion and escalating utility provisioning expenses. On \\naverage, factories across states are only allowed to create floor space up to 1.3 times the \\nplot size.

First, over the last decade, there has been a significant realignment of \\noutput shares among industrial segments. Sectors like chemicals, wood products and furniture, \\npharmaceuticals, transport equipment, steel and machinery and equipment have gained in \\nstrength. Some of these are important industrial intermediates and consumer goods, while \\nthe others cater to requirements of capital formation. On the other hand, sectors like textiles, \\nfood products, beverages and tobacco and petroleum products and leather lost their relative \\npositions. \\n10.39.\\tSecondly, the export-import balance of different industrial segments has vastly varied \\nover the last few years. Consistently, major net exporters include industries such as steel, \\npharmaceuticals, and automobiles. On the other hand, import dependency in key sectors like \\ncoal, capital goods and chemicals continue.\\n10.40.\\tThirdly, the medium-term outlook on the demand for capital goods and key construction \\ninputs like steel and cement is likely to be positive, as there are clear signs that capital formation \\nin the private sector is gathering momentum. Global uncertainties raise question mark on \\nexport demand and the domestic cost of production due to dependence on critical imported \\ninputs like coal, petroleum, steel and machinery.'),\n",

Aided by the focus on policy \\nand procedural reforms, physical infrastructure and logistics, all significant business, \\npersonal, financial and infrastructure-based services have emerged strongly from the \\npandemic. However, the transformation lies in the fast-paced shift towards digital \\nservices like online payments, e-commerce, and entertainment platforms, as well as the \\nincrease in the demand for high-tech services as inputs in other productive activities. \\nIndia's young and tech-savvy population offers an opportunity to enhance the country's \\nvocational and educational ecosystem further.

The significant domestic demand \\nfor services such as education, healthcare, finance, tourism, hospitality, and entertainment is \\nunderpinned by a large and young population. Rapid urbanisation supports transportation, \\nhousing, sanitation, and utility services. The expansion of e-commerce platforms has generated \\nheightened requirements for logistics, digital payments, and related services. Information \\ntechnology and business services will likely retain their prominent international presence in \\nthe medium term.

The \\ncontraction was concentrated in contact-intensive services due to lockdowns, restricted travel, \\nand reduced demand for hospitality, entertainment, and personal services due to preventive \\nmeasures. As the restrictions were lifted, these sectors rebounded, aided by the supportive \\npolicy environment.

Its recommendations include mandatory project registrations with \\nRERA, execution of registration and sub-lease deeds for occupied units, ensuring possession \\nof substantially completed projects, proposing state government rehabilitation packages for \\npromoter-led resolutions, establishing frameworks for RERA and administrator-led project \\nrevivals, financing stalled projects, and utilising IBC as a last resort for resolving projects. \\n11.47\\t According to a report by Crisil, the housing loan market in India grew at a CAGR of \\napproximately 13 per cent from FY18 to FY23. It is expected to continue growing at a CAGR \\nof 13 to 15 per cent reaching ₹42 lakh crore to ₹44 lakh crore by FY26. NHB has introduced \\na Residential Mortgage-Backed Securities (RMBS) platform to address funding options \\nlimitations. This platform aims to attract long-term resources from diverse investor groups, \\nincluding Pension Funds and Insurance Funds, to support the expansion of housing finance \\nand deepen the debt market for primary mortgages. The RMBS platform will help reduce asset-\\nliability mismatches for lending institutions, ensuring adequate liquidity in the housing finance \\nsector.\\n32  \\x07United Nations. (2018).

The digitisation of \\nservices, coupled with appropriate policy nudges, kept progressively transforming the nature of \\nservice delivery almost irreversibly during the early part of the last decade. This trend accelerated \\npost the pandemic. Another distinct pattern that emerged during the last three years is that the \\ncontact-intensive business and personal services—prominently trade, transport, real estate and \\ntheir ancillary services — that underwent a steep decline during the pandemic are recovering, \\nembedding greater technology and digital content in them. At the same time, India’s services \\nexports are diversifying beyond software to include Human Resources (HR), legal, and design \\nservices in line with emerging global demands. Thus, two significant transformations are \\nreshaping India's services landscape: the rapid technology-driven transformation of domestic \\nservice delivery and the diversification of India's services exports. \\n11.75\\t The country is emerging as a hub for Global Capability Centres. Domestically, start-ups \\ndrive innovation, improving access to credit, raw materials, and markets. Aided by the deep \\ntechnology ecosystem and the consistent policy push, many technology start-ups are digitising \\nmanufacturing and other services. The embedded service content of the non-service economic \\nactivities has increased significantly, as evidenced by the National Accounts Statistics. The \\npost-production value addition in activities is also increasingly dependent on services like \\ne-commerce, innovative packaging and advertisement and modern logistics services.  \\n11.76\\t As India looks forward to creating millions of jobs by 2030, dovetailing this transformation \\nin the demand-supply dynamics of services is pivotal to meeting the hiring requirements in \\nthe medium term. The emerging job demands in the services sector entail greater and more \\nfocussed skills. The World Economic Forum's report52 highlights an increasing focus on \\ncognitive abilities (like complex problem-solving and creative thinking), digital literacy, and \\nproficiency in AI and big data. This shift underscores the strategic imperative for businesses \\nand the workforce to adapt to technological advancements and meet global market demands. \\nFocus areas should include blockchain, AI, machine learning, Internet of Things, cybersecurity, \\ncloud computing, big data analytics, augmented reality, virtual reality, 3D printing, and web \\nand mobile development. Thus, the immediate task of the skilling programme in India is to \\n52  \\x07World Economic Forum. (2023).

Section VI summarises the discussions and \\npresents some important aspects of the way forward. \\nINFRASTRUCTURE FINANCING: THE PUBLIC \\nEXPENDITURE PUSH\\n12.3.\\tThis section brings out two important facts about infrastructure financing in India. \\nFirstly, despite many financial innovations in infrastructure financing in the recent years, \\ncapital expenditure by the Union and State Governments still have the central role in funding \\nof large-scale infrastructure projects. Secondly, with the emergence of a number of new funding \\ninstruments and strategies, the infrastructure financing space has become complex, and, given \\nthe differential definitions and patterns followed in maintenance of statistics by different \\nagencies, it is difficult to aggregate the total flow of funds for the creation of infrastructure in \\nany given year. \\n12.4.\\tEven though budgetary capital expenditure cannot be equated to infrastructure spending4, \\nthe infrastructure thrust of the Government has led to an unprecedented increase in capital \\nexpenditure. Chart XII.1 shows that the capital expenditure of the Union Government increased \\nby 2.2 times from FY21 to FY24 (PA) while that of the State governments increased by 2.1 times \\nduring the same period.\\n12.5.\\t The capital expenditure of the Union Government broadly includes two components—\\nthe spending by its line departments and the gross budgetary support (GBS) given to the \\nCentral Public Sector Enterprises (CPSEs). The share of gross budgetary support to two key \\nconnectivity segments, i.e., Railways and National Highway Authority of India, in the total \\ncapital expenditure of the Union Government increased from 36.4 per cent in FY21 to 42.9 per \\ncent in FY24 (RE). These two components of capital expenditure increased by 2.6 times from \\nFY21 to FY24 (RE) in their absolute values.\\n12.6.\\tThe aggregate investible resources of the CPSEs consists of the GBS and the resources \\nraised by CPSEs themselves. In order to optimise the combined borrowing cost of the Union \\nGovernment and the CPSEs, the higher-cost borrowings of the two major infra-CPSEs—NHAI \\nand Indian Railway Finance Corporation (IRFC) - were progressively reduced from FY21 to \\nFY24. This is, to a large extent, reflected in the reduction in the own resources of the CPSEs in \\n4\\u2002 \\x07Capital expenditure of the Government includes its spending to create any capital asset, which may not be created \\nunder a sector classified as infrastructure under the harmonious definition of infrastructure.'),\n",

Since India is a Member State of ICAO, obligated \\nto comply with offsetting requirements i.e., either use sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) or offset \\ntheir emissions by purchasing carbon credits from ICAO approved emissions unit programmes. \\nHowever, there are no ICAO-approved emissions unit programmes in India to supply CORSIA-\\neligible emissions units, to meet the offsetting requirements of airline operators.

The consistent focus on road, rail and air connectivity, sanitation and \\ndigital infrastructure have brought in a considerable growth in assets in these sectors. \\n12.78.\\t However, infrastructure-creation efforts in India are predominantly public sector-led. \\nAs per the Infrastructure Monitor 2023 published by Global Infrastructure Hub and the World \\nBank, India’s investment in infrastructure was largely funded by the public sector – which \\nincludes the Government agencies and state-owned entities and banks31. Between fiscal year \\n2019 and 2023, the Central and State Governments contributed to 49 per cent and 29 per cent \\nof the total investments, respectively, while the private sector contributed 22 per cent32. \\n12.79.\\t For India to continue down the path of building quality infrastructure, a higher level of \\nprivate sector financing and resource mobilisation from new sources will be crucial. Facilitating \\nthis would not only require policy and institutional support from the Central Government, \\nbut State and Local Governments would have to play an equally important role. International \\nexperience shows us how initiatives at the sub-national level can facilitate resource mobilisation \\nfor infrastructure development. Examples include pooled financing mechanisms for municipal \\nprojects33, specialised municipal intermediaries34, asset recycling programs35, tax increment \\nfinancing36 and land sales and development rights37 among other innovative approaches.

The Intergovernmental Panel on \\nClimate Change (IPCC)4 paints a dire picture - emissions pose a serious threat since CO2, once \\nreleased into the atmosphere, can hang for 300 to 1000 years5, causing global warming and \\nenvironmental destruction such as the melting of polar ice caps.  \\n13.6.\\tTo achieve the stated objectives, the world has adopted a strategy that comprises a \\nset of pathways, popularly called ‘climate adaptation’ and ‘climate mitigation’. Most of this \\nincludes shifting to energy sources other than fossil fuels, enhancing energy efficiency through \\ninnovative and environment-friendly design, adopting regenerative and environmentally \\nsensitive agricultural practices, as well as protecting and restoring the natural ecosystems (See \\nBox XIII.2).\\nBox XIII.2: WEO-2023 proposes a global strategy for getting the world on track by  2030\\nThe Five Key Pillars to this proposal include:\\n•\\t\\n\\x07Tripling global Renewable Energy Capacity.\\n•\\t\\nDoubling the rate of Energy Efficiency improvements.\\n•\\t\\nSlashing methane emissions from fossil fuel operations by 75 per cent.\\n•\\t\\n\\x07Innovative, large-scale financing mechanisms to triple clean energy investments in \\nemerging and developing economies. \\n•\\t\\n\\x07Measures to ensure an orderly decline in the use of fossil fuels, including an end to new \\napprovals of unabated coal-fired power plants.\\nWHY IS THE CURRENT APPROACH FLAWED?\\n13.7.\\t To inform the design of emission-limiting pathways, IPCC has quantified the remaining \\ncarbon space available as the “carbon budget.” As per their estimates, from the beginning of \\n2020, the world has approximately 500 GtCO2 left for a target of 1.5°C and 1150 GtCO2 for \\na target of 2°C (with a likelihood of 50% and 67%, respectively). With each passing year, the \\nbudget gets smaller, and the time available to act slips away. Nations are then expected to \\ncommit to “accelerated and equitable mitigation pathways” while walking the tightrope of \\ndevelopmental demands.

Under the golden wrapper of a committed USD100bn \\nfinancing, the elves are at work polishing the quirks, as is evidenced in this small fact reported \\nby Hindustan Times36 - At the Cartagena Ad Hoc Work Programme (AHWP) talks — in the run-\\nup to the actual negotiations at the Conference of Parties (CoP) — the United States and other \\nwestern countries have reportedly pushed to make the New Collective Quantified Goal (NCQG) \\ncontributions “voluntary” for those who “choose to pay”. They have also advocated widening \\nthe pool of contributors to include developing nations based on the latter’s “economic realities” \\nand “current emission share”. So, the reason behind this vacillation on ‘Who’s to pay’ is well-\\nindicated through Box XIII.3.\\nBox XIII.3: Willingness to Change and Willingness to pay for \\nEnvironmentally Sustainable Policies\\nOne would imagine that given most of the climate sustainability debate largely stems from \\nthe developed world, they would be the first ones to accept the financial impact of changing \\ntheir consumption-oriented lifestyle. However, research says otherwise. Almost 63% of \\nrespondents of the OECD Environmental Policies and Individual Behaviour Change Survey \\nin 2022 (administered to over 17,000 households) feel that sustainable choices should not \\nimpact them financially and therefore ‘they are unwilling to pay extra’. Contrast this directly \\nwith the CBAM tax that EU is willing to impose on products such as steel, for the so-called \\n‘fair price on carbon emitted’ during production, imported from developing countries.  In the \\nsame survey, ~43% of respondents reported regular consumption of red meat and showed \\nresistance to changing this lifestyle attribute with a large impact on climate change. The \\nanalysis further indicates that households’ general proclivity to the environment, does not \\ninfluence their frequency of red meat consumption.\\nAt this rate, the question seems less about sustainable choices, but more about a new play \\nfor capitalism. Having exhausted the extant industrial networks and saturation in product \\nconsumption, one can only create space for a whole new dynamic of industrial consumption \\n- new industrial products, new markets, and new ways of taxing the ones still struggling to \\nsurvive, so that the old status quo keeps thriving, and the ‘emerging’ are in a perpetual state \\nof question.\\nADOPTING THE WESTERN PRACTICES HAS NEGATIVE \\nENVIRONMENTAL IMPLICATIONS FOR THE DEVELOPING \\nWORLD\\n13.40.\\t With the largest population in the world, India has only the 7th largest area, culminating \\nin a significant resource constraint.

As societies settled and civilisations oriented around agriculture emerged \\nin various parts of the world, the human race moved to a blend of plant- and animal-based \\ncuisines over time. With time, improvements in agricultural research facilitated a significant \\nexpansion of the available plant-based food options, which are rich in nutrients and offer \\nsignificant health benefits. Agricultural research has made it so that today, if one chooses to do \\nso, it is completely possible for a human to meet all the nutritional requirements of their body \\nfrom an exclusively plant-based diet and live a long, healthy life.\\n13.46.\\t However, since the preference for meat is part of our evolutionary process and our \\ndigestive systems being clearly selected for an omnivorous diet, meat remains an important part \\nof the nutritional mix. As societies moved towards affluence, the quantity of meat demanded \\nalso rose. North America and Europe saw their meat production grow by 2.5 times and 1.7 times, \\nrespectively, between 1961 and 200039. More important is the fact that increased production in \\nthese regions was facilitated by the emergence of the modern mass-scale feed industry, which \\nnow presents a credible and significant threat to food security around the globe.\\n13.47.\\t The feed industry has emerged as such a massive undertaking that 33 per cent of the \\ntotal arable land on the planet is now being utilised for feed crop production40, and new land \\nbeing added through deforestation41  or repurposing existing farmlands42. Further, the reliance \\non human-edible crops under the Western method of meat production has set into motion \\na food-feed competition43 as more than one-third of the global cereal produced is utilised as \\nanimal feed. At the same time, one in ten humans still do not get enough to eat44.\\n13.48.\\t  A recent analysis published in ‘Nature’ highlighted that only 37 per cent of the harvested \\narea of major crops is used for direct food consumption,45 while a large share of the human-\\nedible crops is now facing competing uses, primarily from the livestock industry.

These concerns had \\nalready been elucidated 22 years ago by Gerbens-Leenes & Nonhebel (2022)58. They stated, “In \\nWestern countries, the influence of food consumption patterns on related land requirement is \\nsubstantial, resulting in large regional as well as inter-generational differences…On a global \\nscale, it should be realized that a large part of the population is undernourished…If patterns \\nin developing countries shift towards the affluent menus of western countries, related per \\ncapita land requirements will rise substantially.” India is already among the largest producers \\nof meat in the world. Adopting the same practices followed elsewhere would result in disastrous \\nconsequences for the environment and the people at large.\\n13.54.\\t Traditional farming practices from the developing world, where several agricultural \\nactivities are integrated with livestock rearing, offer one solution to the problem. Taking the \\nexample of India, our agricultural sector, primarily small and medium farm undertakings \\nthat engage in agriculture and livestock cultivation, has been practising sustainable farming \\nfor decades now (also called Integrated Farming System)59. By recycling farm waste and by-\\nproducts from other agricultural activities to serve as inputs for another activity (human inedible \\nsources of feed such as grass and weeds plucked from fields, chaff and stubble collected post-\\nharvest, and other agro-waste), farming enterprises within India have been able to lower costs \\nof production and enhance the productivity of their undertakings without upsetting the natural \\ncycle. Similarly, the Integrated Farming Systems tested in African countries demonstrated that \\nlivestock-based integration not only helped the daily agricultural processes but also helped \\nmitigate food security and malnutrition risks in humans as well as livestock60.\\n13.55.\\t Shifting livestock to human-inedible feed can free up significant shares of global arable \\nland to address global hunger. More food crops can be directed towards human consumption \\nand alleviate food security risks worldwide.

On average, a \\ntypical nuclear family in India had an average of 3 members vis-a-vis 7 in a joint family setup \\n– nucleation rising in South India as opposed to North India. This is a major shift from our \\nolder societal norms of multi-generational living with Hindu undivided families (HUF) living \\nunder the same roof.  Chapter 8 of this survey on India’s labour markets notes that a report by \\nthe United Nations Population Fund and the International Institute for Population Sciences \\nemphasises the importance of elderly people living in multi-generational households. Indians \\ndid not really have to learn this from a United Nations report. It was part of our tradition. \\nNaturally nucleated living gives rise to demand for additional housing units, smaller and more \\nindependent in nature. Given that the demand is only expected to double by 205064 and the \\nsheer complexity involved due to urban areas in size ranging from over 15 million to a few \\nthousand people as well as local vs new settlements, and different housing-building practices, \\nIndia has a looming housing issue on the horizon.\\n61  \\x07Hannah Ritchie (2021) - “If the world adopted a plant-based diet, we would reduce global agricultural land use \\nfrom 4 to 1 billion hectares” Published online at OurWorldInData.org.

Materiality was linked to long periods of sacrifice \\nand the rare acquisition that fuelled feelings of happiness. \\n13.89.\\t It's a philosophical shift from the way we understand life. A large body of research79 \\nhas brought forward the theory of the ‘Paradox of Choice’ that runs counterintuitive to the \\nideas of Capitalism.  Even though choice is good for us, its relationship to contentment is quite \\ncomplicated, and choice overload80  leads to a large set of negative outcomes.

It is not stoppage, it is not stagnation, and it is not even a compromise. \\nIt is a human’s ability to have the confidence and the power to opt for internal stability to \\nprepare for and accept outside change. It is only when humans can channel this energy that \\nthey can stop asking for more. It is the absence of such contentment that has made erstwhile \\ncommunal things in the home become individual – e.g., television.  Things unavailable didn’t \\ncause grown men to cry and children to shrink from playing with others. This stands in contrast \\nwith the consumption-oriented living of today, where every individual is a consumer (especially \\nchildren81), instead of a family. That’s why households, today, need more devices per person \\nas compared to a single television earlier. Within that one statement lies the entire linkage \\nbetween social mores, overconsumption, disposability, and growing mountains of trash.

       "  'content': 'CONCLUSION\\n9.48\\t The performance of the agriculture sector remains critical for the economy’s growth and \\nhas been growing at an average growth rate of 4.18 per cent over the last five years. The growing \\nsignificance of allied sectors such as animal husbandry, dairying, and fisheries in enhancing \\nfarmers’ income suggests that greater emphasis should be placed on tapping into the potential \\nof these activities to boost farmers’ incomes. Smallholder farmers’ incomes cannot be increased \\nby producing rice, wheat, or even millets, pulses and oilseeds. They need to move to high-value \\nagriculture – fruits and vegetables, fisheries, poultry, dairy and buffalo meat. Once the incomes \\nof smallholders increase, they will demand manufactured goods, spurring a manufacturing \\nrevolution. That is what happened in China between 1978 and 1984 when the real incomes of \\nfarmers doubled in just 6 years. India is well-placed to emulate this.',\n",
